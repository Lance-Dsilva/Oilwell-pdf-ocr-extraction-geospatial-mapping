Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting) \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21 -19 11B [Lot 2  Section 1 9, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of W illiston in McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within \nthe Williston Basin consisting of one 9,615 ' lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical hole was \nplanned to be drilled to approximately 10,230’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ \nto land within the Middle Bakken . This well is a two  section lateral which originates in the  \nnorthwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the southeast quarter of section 20. \nDirectional drilling technologies and geo- steering techniques were used to land in the Middle \nBakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock."

Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to \nsuccessfully land within the Middle Bakken. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray \nsignatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in \norder to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was \nperiodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Charles Formation  [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,536' MD 8,535 ' TVD        \n(-6,459' SS).  Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a lime  \nmudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was \nmicrocrystalline, friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity  \nwas observed as was occasional to rare spotty light brown oil stain. Occasionally noted was a \ndolo-mudstone, which was light brown, light gray,  light gray brown in color. It was \nmicrocrystalline, friable -firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also noted was a  trace of \nintercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely noted was anhydrite, \nwhich was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and massive with an earthy to \namorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non- circulation, gas peaks of 35 to 54 \nunits were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 62 to 89 units.   \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,431 ' MD 9, 430' \nTVD ( -7,354' SS). The Mission Canyon F ormation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown  to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray  in color. The lime \nmudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some \nintervals contained a trace of black -brown algal material , a trace of fossil fragments,  and traces \nof disseminated pyrite. Also present was an a rgillaceous lime mudstone that was described as \nlight gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gra y in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite.   F ollowing connections or periods of \nnon-circulation, gas peaks of 35 to 191 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 40 to 109 \nunits. Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light brown \noil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. \n \n                                           \n  \nFigure 2.

The previously run Cavare motor was adjusted to 2.45 degrees and \nattached to bit #5, a Security MMD55M PDC bit.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 &20 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the \nentire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must co ntact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-\n770-3554 prior to location construction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to  bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, us ed and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authoriz ed representative of the director prior to lining and use.   \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilize d in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 9963’ east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E. Hicks \n  Assistant Director"
