      "text": "Geologic Assessment \n \nMethods \n \nGeologic supervision of Wade Federal 5300 21-30H was provided by two experienced RPM well \nsite geologists.  Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using iBall Instruments \nBloodhound (Bloodhound) real time gas detector and chromatograph system.  The Bloodhound \ngas detection system uses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate \ngases liberated from the formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid. \n \nThe Bloodhound was interfaced with a Canrig electronic data recorder system. Canrig provided \nrate of penetration, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the Bloodhound and received total gas \ninformation from the Bloodhound for viewing on location and remotely. \n \nUnder the direction of RPM well site geologist, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill \ncutting samples at 30’ intervals from 8,250 to the kick off point (KOP) at 10,172’.  Samples were \ncontinuously logged at 30’ intervals during the curve and throughout the lateral section. \n \nSampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using plain \n(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by \nimmersion in carbo-sol (trichloroethylene) and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% \nhydrochloric acid and alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content \nof rocks and cementing. \n \n \nVertical Operations \n \nOverview \n \nThe Wade Federal 5300 21-30H was spud on 5 April 2011 using Nabors 149 drilling rig.  Prior \nto Rig up of RPM mud logging services, a 9 5/8” hole was drilled with fresh water to \ndepth of 2,018’ and isolated with 9 5/8” 36# J-55 casing cemented to surface. The vertical \nborehole was drilled with bit #1 in 9 hours with an average ROP equal to 213.3 ft/hr.  Bit #2 (8 \n¾” Smith PDC) was used to drill from 2,018’ to KOP at 10,172’ yielding an average ROP of \n95.8 ft/hr. \n \nRPM well site geologists arrived at site on 10 April 2011 and began logging the vertical section \nat 8,250’.   \n \nDiesel invert drilling fluid with a mud weight of ranging from 9.7-10.0 ppg was used during \nremainder of the vertical hole and in the curve builds sections.  \n \nSchlumberger performed openhole electronic logging operations on 13 April 2011. \n \n \nLithology \n \nThe top of the Kibbey Lime [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,320’ (-6,008’), 83’ \nlow to the Verlin Fossum 26-1.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback (per ICO 14498) \nfrom the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30-T153N-R100W . \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETROLEUM must contact NDIC Field Inspector John Axtman \nat 701-770-2564 prior to location construction. \nNew Policy \nOperators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report . If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances , the factors of ND.AC 43-02-03-16 .2 (1 ), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \nPermit Fee & Notification \nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received . It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, compan y representative , date and time of spudding . Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time.

Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner . Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov . \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore. \nReserve pit \nPlease be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on \nthis site if specific site conditions warrant. \nSurface casing cement \nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests. \nLogs \nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of \ncement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma \nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as \none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image \nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced \nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to \nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a \nTIFF (*. tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*. tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its \nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5'' floppy diskette, a standard \nCD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov \nThank you for your cooperation. \nSincerely, \nNathaniel Erbele \nPetroleum Resource Specialist"
