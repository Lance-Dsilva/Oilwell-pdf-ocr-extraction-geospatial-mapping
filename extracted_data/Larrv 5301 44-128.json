The formation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these \nwells, and the Oasis Petroleum North Amer ica, LLC Kline 5300 11-18H [Lot 1 Section \n18, T153N, R100W] were used to assist in landing the curv e. This was accomplished by \ncomparing gamma signatures from the offset  wells to gamma data collected during \ndrilling operations. The casing target landing tr ue vertical depth (TVD) was periodically \nupdated to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  Data used in this evaluation are found in \nthis report."

Gas data was fed from Sunburst’s digital gas \ndetector, a total gas chromatograph, thr ough Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon \nconstituents (C 1 through C 4) were recorded in part-per-million concentrations. Gas \nsampling was pulled through ¼” polyflo tubing af ter agitation in Sunb urst’s gas trap at \nthe shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at  the direction of the well site geologists. \nSamples were collected at 30’ intervals in the vertical/curve and 30’ intervals in the \nlateral. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry conditions under a 10x45 power \nbinocular microscope (for detailed lithologic de scriptions see appendix). Cuttings were \nsent to North Dakota Geologic Survey. In addi tion to rock samples, rate of penetration \nand gamma ray data were also used in geol ogic analysis to aid geo-steering and dip \ncalculations.  \n \nLithology \n \nFormation analysis began at 8,170’ MD with a red orange silts tone and anhydrite \ncharacteristic of the Kibbey Formation \n[Mississippian Big Snowy Group].

      "text": "As the well bore moved from the top to the bottom of the preferred drilling zone, gamma \nAPI counts, collected samples, and gas were evaluated along with penetration rates to \nidentify areas within the 10’ preferred drilling zone that yielded the best penetration rates. \nOffset logs identified by Oasis representatives indicated a porosity zones in the upper and \nlower portion of the 10’ preferred drilling zone.  \n \nIt should be noted that in the later portion of the lateral, after connections, the MWD tool, \nwould intermittently produce gamma API counts that were in excess of 200 API This \nbegan at approximately 17,700’ MD until TD. Dr illing would proceed with these values \nuntil the API counts dropped to what were considered normal values, then the driller \nwould pick up and re-log the erroneous gamma ray data. These distances ranged from 10’ \nto 60’. The gamma API counts from approximately 17,700’ MD to TD, also appeared to \nshift lower by approximately 10 to 15 API un its, making it difficult to correlate with \ngamma previously seen in the lateral.  \n \nDrilling out of intermediate casing the early in clinations were above 90 degrees. Offset \nlogs and information provided by Oasis repres entatives indicated that the well bore was \nto follow a downward path during the early portion of the lateral, which led onsite \npersonnel to steer the well bore down to a pos ition in the lower portion of the preferred \ndrilling zone, where it remained for the greater portion of the lateral. The assembly while \ndrilling in the lower portion of the target in terval, began oscillating between two tight \nstreaks located above and below it. Gamma values  that ranged from the mid forties to the \nmid thirties, along with the pres ence of limestone in collected  samples indicated that the \nwell bore had encountered the overlying limes tone member. Gamma values in the mid \nthirties to low forties indicated without the presence of limestone that the well bore had \nencountered the hard streak below it, a we ll-cemented silty sandstone. Between these \ntight streaks the gamma counts ranged form the mid forties to the mid sixties. As noted \nearlier, from approximately 17,700’ MD to TD , these values shifte d 10 to 15 API counts \nlower.  \n \nAs the well bore drilled to the south, the overlying limestone member appeared to thin, \nuntil it was no longer logged with gamma or observed in drill cuttings. The well bore \nthen moved up to the upper portion of the pref erred drilling zone, and even above it. The \nwell bore, while above the target interval pers istent to rise on rotation, and continued to \ndeflect off of a tight streak located below it. It became necessary to institute many down \nside slides to keep the well bore from striking the overlying upper Bakken shale.  \n \nTotal depth (TD) of 20,464’ MD was reac hed at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012.

      "text": "SUMMARY  \n \nThe Larry 5301 44-12B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken \ndevelopment program. The project was drilled from surface to TD in 19 days. The TD of \n21,140’ MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT August 3, 2012. The well site team worked \nwell together maintaining the well bore in th e desired target inte rval for 92% of the \nlateral, opening 9,812’ of potentially productive reservoir rock \n \nDiesel invert drilling fluid 9.6-9.9 ppg for the vertical hole and 9.9-10.3 ppg for curve \noperations were used to maintain stable hole co nditions, minimize washout through the salt \nintervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.  \n \nSamples in the Middle Bakken were generally silty sandstone which was varying shades \nof gray, off white to white, tan, very fine grained silty sandstone consisting of moderately \nsorted, subangular quartz grains. Additiona lly this facies was moderately calcite \ncemented; with a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Poor intergranular porosity \nwas observed, as was a trace of light brown spotty oil stain . Also present in varying \namounts was a light brown to brown, translucen t, with a trace of off white sandstone. \nThis sandstone was fine to very fine grained, friable, with subangular to subround quartz \ngrains which were moderately sorted, and cal cite cemented. Also present was a trace of \ndisseminated and nodular pyrite. It had from fair to poor intergranular porosity, with even \nand spotty light brown oil stain.  \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains provided ev idence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir \nduring the drilling of the La rry 5301 44-12B. Oil a nd gas shows at the shakers and in \nsamples were continuously monitored. In th e closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions \nwere maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be \nmonitored. Gas on the Larry 5301 44-12B varied  according to penetration rates and \nlocation of the well bore in the stratigra phic column. Observed concentrations ranged \nfrom 3,000 to 4,000 units background gas, a nd connection peaks of 6,000 to 8,000 units \nin earlier portion of the lateral where shows were the best. In the later portion of the \nlateral flow was diverted through the gas buster, effectively muting recordable gas values. \nThere were no trips during the drilling of the lateral therefore no trip gases were noted. \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Larry  5301 44-12B awaits completion operations to \ndetermine its ultimate production potential. \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nZA jtçÇx cxàxÜáÉÇ \nc/o Sunburst Consulting, Inc.  \n6 August, 2012"

The approval is \ngranted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200' setback from the \nnorth & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of \nSections 13 & 24 T153N, R101W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: DUE TO SURFICIAL WATER ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS \nREQUIRED SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE LOCATION.  In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an \noff-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirm ing that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to \naccept burial on their property of the cuttings generated fr om drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling \nunit.  Tool error is not required pursuant to order.  OASIS PETRO. NO. AMER. must contact NDIC Field \nInspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and \ncompletion operations, providing th e pit can be constructed, used  and reclaimed in a manner th at will prevent pollution of \nthe land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited\n. All pits shall be \ninspected by an authorized representative  of the director prior to lining and use.   Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized \nin a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The \nproposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 450’ \nsouth.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates from the well head are: 10570’ \nsouth and 300’ east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until th e 3rd business day following publication of the approved \ndrilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd \nbusiness day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting peri od may be waived by the Director.  \nApplication for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit provid ing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating \ncircumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other in formation that would allow the Director to \nconclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card  .The permit fee has been rece ived.  It is requested that \nnotification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas \nDivision, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information mu st be included:  Well name, le gal location, permit number, \ndrilling contractor, company repres entative, date and time of sp udding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 \np.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend."

Surveys must be submitted as \none electronic copy, or in a form approved  by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be \nfiled immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  \nCertified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when \nsliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail \ncement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or \ninitiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of cement can be \ndetermined in every well in which produc tion or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma Ray Log must be run from \ntotal depth to ground level elevation of th e well bore.  All logs must be submitted as one paper c opy and one digital copy in \nLAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format appr oved by the Director.  Image logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, \nCement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, ca nnot be produced in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create a \nsolution and establish a standard format for industry to follow when submitting image logs, th e Director has given approval \nfor the operator to submit an image log as  a TIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when \nthe log cannot be produced in its entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” \nfloppy diskette, a standard CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov\n    \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n        \n       S i n c e r e l y ,   \n \n       N a t h a n i e l  E r b e l e   \n       P e t r o l e u m  R e s o u r c e  S p e c i a l i s t"
