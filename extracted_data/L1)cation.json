The primary pay zone was \napproximately 20’ under the bottom of the Upper Bakken Shale. This pay zone was \npicked for its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to \nsteer the well within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. \nDirectional and MWD services were performed by Schlumberger/Pathfinder and RPM. \nHeather A. Coutts, Jake Robertson and Dylan E. Fowler were the primary well site \ngeologists; providing geo1steering and mud logging from Columbine Logging, Inc. \n \nWell Information  \n \nAPI #:      331053105954                     F\n ield: Baker \n \nSpud Date: 10/31//2014                                                  TD Date: 10/31/2014 \n \nSurface Location: 910' FSL & 280' FWL SEC 30, T153N, R100W, McKenzie County, North Dakota. \n \nIntermediate Casing Point: 994’ FSL & 773’ FWL; SEC 30; 11,032’ MD, 10,725’ TVD \n                                                                                                                                            \nBottom Hole Location:  994’ FSL & 773’ FEL; SEC 30; 20,450’ MD, 10,812’ TVD \n \nSurface Elevation: 2045’                                                 KB: 2076’  \n  \nCasing Shoe: 11,032’ MD, 10,727’ TVD                        Total Depth Drilled: 20,450’ \n \nOperator: Oasis                                                                Rig: Patterson 488                             \n \nCompany man:  Tyler LaClaire, Bob Brown                   Well-site Geologist: Heather Coutts                                             \n                Jake Robertson, Dylan E.

Services provided \nin\ncluded; morning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample \nexamination, sample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, \ngeo steering, sample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well \nreport. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur offset GR TVD logs were from the Wade Federal 5300 41130 9B well, located on the \nsa\nme well pad as Wade Federal 5300 41130 6B. Within the Middle Bakken, the primary \nobjective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter layering \nbetween dolomitic siltstone and limy sandstones. Gamma patterns were compared with \nthe offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in \nthe targeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from \nrelevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine \nour position within the formation. \n \nThis well contained two Upper Bakken shale strikes leading to two sidetracks (please \nrefer to Figure 4.1). The first shale strike was at 13,500’ MD; 10,721’ TVD and the \nsecond at approximately 15,100’ MD; 10736’ TVD.  \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder.  The \nmajority of the well was drilled within the target area of the Middle Bakken.   \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.\n2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft \nwhile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl1, alizarin red and \nca\nlcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp.   ",

      "text": " \n \n \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsy\nstem uses an infra1red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S, \nO2 and CO2.  \n \nTh\ne Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non1dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally1occurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant re1calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, open1hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed. \n \n3.0 GEOLOGY\n \n \n3.1 Formation Tops Formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify markers in the \ncu\nrve and lateral (Table 3.1).  \nFORMATION TOPS \nFormation/Marker Beds ACTUAL Prognosis \nVertical Section Top MD (ft) Top TVD (ft) TH ICKNESS (ft) Difference (ft) TVD KB/DF(ft) \nTVD\nSS \n(ft) \nKibbey Lime 8348 8347 144 0 8347 -6277 \nCharles Salt 8492 8491 685 -1 8490 -6420 \nBase Last Salt 9177 9176 215 0 9176 -7106 \nMission Canyon 9392 9391 543 1 9392 -7322 \nLodgepole 9935 9934 736 0 9934 -7864 \nFalse Bakken 10768 10670 9 -11 10659 -8589 \nUpper Bakken Shale 10786 10679 17 -4 10675 -8605 \nMiddle Bakken 10827 10696 12 -3 10693 -8623 \nMiddle Bakken Top of Target 10827 10708 13 -3 10705 -8635 \nMiddle Bakken Base of Target 10827 10721 16 -3 10718 -8648 \nLower Bakken Shale 10827 10737   -3 10734 -8664 ",

Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 \n(Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable electric lighting generato r, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any \nproducing well or oil tank.”  Oasis may set conductor on permitted wells only.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC \nField Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and comp letion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and recl aimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an autho rized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.   Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed dir ectional \nplan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10042’E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilli ng permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day followin g \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.

Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a \nform approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completio n if the \nsurvey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Certified surveys must be submitted via  email in one \nadobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when s liding) and 90 \nfeet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement \nutilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones \ncan be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from whic h the \npresence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which prod uction \nor intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  All logs run must be submitted free of  charge, as \none digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) form atted copy.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E.
