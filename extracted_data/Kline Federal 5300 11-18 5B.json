Xtreme 21 drilling Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B during May 2015 \nin Williams County, North Dakota. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum, North America, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B [Lot 1. Section 18, T153N, \nR100W] is located approximately 4 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. \nThe Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within the Williston Basin \nconsisting of one 9,773’ lateral drilled toward the East. Geologically, the Williston Basin is an \nintracratonic, structural, and sedimentary basin located at the western edge of the Canadian Shield. \nWithin the basin, the Middle Bakken  Formation (Late Devonian to early Mississippian) consists \nof four members: the basal pronghorn member (formerly recognized as the Sanish Siltstone) which \nunderlies lower and upper organic-rich shale members deposited above and below the clastic and \ncoastal-carbonate middle member which consists of calcareous and dolomitic silty sandstone and \nsiltstone shore facies.  \n \nENGINEERING  \n \nThe Kline Federal 5300 11- 18 5B surface, vertical and curve were drilled earlier in 2015 by a \ndifferent drilling rig. Extreme 21 returned to the location in May 2015 to drill the laterals of the \nKline Federal 5300 11-18 5B, 3T, 2B. The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B was re-entered on May \n15, 2015. To start the lateral, a 6″ Baker Hughes PDC bit, Ryan Directional Services MWD tool, \nand a 1.5° adjustable Baker Hughes mud motor were used. The complete BHA accomplishment \nare tabulated in an appendix (BHA Record) to this report. The well reached total depth (TD) at \n20,895' MD at 07:15 hrs CDT on May 20, 2015, generating an exposure of 9,773’ linear feet of 6″ \nhole through the Middle Bakken target interval. The bottom hole location (BHL) lies 1,137.92' \nsouth & 9,944.75' east of surface location or approximately 2,187.92' FNL & 325.56' FEL Lot 1. \nSec. 17, T153N, R100W."

The Middle Bakken displa yed gamma counts ranging from 70 -130 API. The middle \nmember was composed of a  light brown gray to \nlight gray , silty sandstone. It was apparent that \nsamples observed higher in the member were often \nlight brown or off white in color, while the lower \nportion of the member were predominantly gray to \ndark gray. Throughout the Middle Bakken trace \namounts of both disseminated and nodular pyrite \nwere observed. The silty sandstone was most often \nvery fine grained , but occasionally fine grained.  \nSamples were observed as being moderately, \noccasionally well  cemented with . The Middle \nBakken displayed a trace spotty and occasionally \neven, light brown oil stain and trace intergranular \nporosity.  \n \nFigure 2. Silty sandstone, observed in the upper portion of \nthe target interval. \n \nGas and Oil Shows  \n \nHydrocarbon shows at the beginning of the lateral were relatively low to begin the lateral. During \nthe first ~2,000’ of lateral operations the wellbore remained primarily near the base if not below \nthe target zone. While drilling this interval background gasses rarely exceeded 400 units, but \nconnection and survey gasses regularly exceeded 1 ,000 units. Fluorescent cuts throughout this \nperiod of drilling were poor, with most reacting slowly with a pale yellow diffuse. Although shows \nwere poor, there was a small amount of light green oil observed on the shakers. This light green \noil was observed throughout the entire lateral. As the wellbore reached the top of the target interval \nhydrocarbon shows increased for a brief interval. This brief period of gas shows increasing \noccurred twice while drilling along the upper portion of the target zone. The first from 13,170’ -\n13,510’, and also from 14,030’ -14,450’. Although these optimistic shows were intermittent, \nsamples displayed a more promising oil sta ining that that observed in lower samples. Samples \nalong the upper portion displayed a light to medium brown even oil staining. Fluorescent cuts were \nalso slightly more promising than those observed lower in zone were. Cuts were described as \nmoderate, pale yellow, streaming, becoming diffuse. While drilling from 15,190’ -16,050’ there \nwere issues with the gas detection, this caused shows to read very low. When the system was \nrepaired gas shows immediately climbed. From this point to 20,895’ (TD) the most promising \nshows of the lateral were observed. For the remainder of the well, despite of the wellbore was high"

Unfortunately, due to heavy contamination from drill lube there were no fluorescent \ncut performed during this interval. Although hydrocarbon shows remained consistent despite of \nposition within the target zone, the most promising oil staining remained to be in the upper most \nportion of the target interval.  In the future this upper portion should be targeted for a more \npromising well. \n \nGEOSTEERING \n \nThe potential pay zone of the Cook 5300 12- 13 8B was identified by evaluating gamma data \ncollected while drilling the Oasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 41 -18 11T2. The target was \ndetermined to be 10’ thick, be 13’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and 20’ above the Lower Bakken \nShale. The target was identified by having a warm gamma marker at the very top of target, \nmoderate markers throughout the target zone and a cool marker at the base of zone. The target \ninterval was not based on high porosity but rather creating a safe interval for drilling a lateral with \nminimal risks of contacting the shale. Over all the structure’s dip rate was very similar to what was \nexpected with a gross apparent dip of 0.2° down.  \n \n \n \nFigure 3.

The Kline Federal 5300 11 -18 5B reached a total \ndepth of 20,895' MD on May 20, 2015. Geologic data, hydrocarbon gas measurements, and sample \nexamination obtained during the Kline Federal 5300 11- 18 5B  indicate an encouraging \nhydrocarbon system in the Middle Bakken. Positive connection and survey shows were recorded \nthroughout the lateral . Samples from the target zone consist ed of light brown- off white , silty \nsandstone. A trace, light brown oil stain that yielded a slow, white, poor, diffuse to streaming cut \nfluorescence. Lateral operations were successful in exposing 9,773' of potentially productive \nMiddle Bakken target zone rock to the wellbore . The well was within the targeted zone for 83% \nof the lateral.   \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n Dillon Johnson \n Well-site Geologist \n Sunburst Consulting, Inc. \n May 20, 2015"

A few key points: \n1) We will move the rig to the Carson SWD pad once we have finished drilling the vertical portions of all 3 wells on \nthis pad. \n2) We will finish drilling the vertical portion of the third well, the Kline Federal S300 11-18 2B, on April 9th . \n3) We will utilize a 2 nd rig to drill the lateral portions of the 3 wells on this pad. \n4) The 2 nd rig is currently drilling wells on a different pad and is scheduled to reach TD on the final well in late \nMay/early June, leaving a gap of approximately SS days. \nS) We will be able to return to the Kline Federal S300 11-18 pad on or before June 6th . \nGiven the time sensitive nature of this request , expedited review of these sundries would be greatly appreciated. \nThank you for your consideration , \nMichael P.

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Intends to drill the surface hole with \nfreshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The \ncasing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No \nsaltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is \ncemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting \ninto the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to \ncomplete the drllllng and casing plan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of \ndrilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to \ntake advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an Initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to \ndrill a well to total depth but Is not Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obllgatlon \nunder, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.
