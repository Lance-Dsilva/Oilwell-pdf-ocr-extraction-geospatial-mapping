Services provided\nincluded; morning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample\nexamination, sample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog,\ngeo steering, sample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well\nreport.\n2.1.1 Geosteering\nOur offset GR TVD logs were from the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H well, located on the\nsame well pad as Wade Federal 5300 41-30 2B. Within the Middle Bakken, the primary\nobjective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter layering\nbetween dolomitic siltstone and limy sandstones. Gamma patterns were compared with\nthe offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in\nthe targeted zone. Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from\nrelevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine\nour position within the formation.\n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys\nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder. The\nmajority of the well was drilled within the target area of the Middle Bakken.\n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.)\n2.2.1 Sample Examination\nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft\nwhile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous\ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence.\nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and\ncalcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV\nlamp.\n2.2.2 Gas Detection\nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection\nsystem uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates\nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit\nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S,\nO2 and CO .\n2",

      "text": "The Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing\ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection. The\nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to\n10,000 gas units. This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon\ngas mixtures. Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases. Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%,\nand 100% pure methane. Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of\nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of\nconstant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to\nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution.\nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump\noutput, open-hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and\nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations\nand thereby adjust lag time when needed.\n3.0 GEOLOGY\n3.1 Formation Tops Formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify markers in the\ncurve and lateral (Table 3.1).\nFORMATION TOPS\nFormation/Marker Beds ACTUAL Prognosis\nTVDSS\nVertical Section Top MD (ft) Top TVD (ft) THICKNESS (ft) Difference (ft) TVD KB/DF(ft) (ft)\nKibbey Lime 8352 8351 144 -4 8347 -6270\nCharles Salt 8496 8495 676 -4 8491 -6414\nBase Last Salt 9172 9171 216 -3 9168 -7091\nMission Canyon 9388 9387 547 -3 9384 -7307\nLodgepole 9935 9934 738 -2 9932 -7855\nFalse Bakken 10786 10672 8 -7 10665 -8588\nUpper Bakken Shale 10807 10680 18 -5 10675 -8598\nMiddle Bakken 10868 10698 ~34 -4 10694 -8617\nMiddle Bakken (Top of Target) 10866 10706 n/a -4 10702 -8625\nMiddle Bakken (Base of target) 10866 10717 n/a -4 10713 -8636\nLower Bakken Shale 10866 10730 ~11 -4 10726 -8649\nTable 3.1 Wade Federal 5300 31-30 2B Formation Tops\n3.2 Lithology\nSample analysis began at 8,000’ MD in the Otter Formation.\n3.3 Formation Dip\nThe formation had an average dip of 89.4ο.\n3.4 Shows\nThe vertical-build section was drilled with invert mud and the lateral was drilled with\nbrine/production water.

The primary pay zone was 20’\nunder the bottom of the Upper Bakken Shale. This pay zone was picked for its production\npotential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well within the\ndefined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state.\nThe primary objective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter\nlayering between dolomitic siltstone and limy sandstones. Gamma patterns were\ncompared with the offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in\norder to land in the targeted zone. Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating\ndip from relevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to\ndetermine our position within the formation.\nThe formation had an average dip of 89.4ο. (see pg. 5, fig 4.1 for a detailed formation dip\nprofile).\nCurrently the well is awaiting completion.\n________________________________________________________________________\nHeather Coutts, Well-Site Geologist\nColumbine Logging, Inc.\n9844 Titan Ct.

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a\nsmall drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the\nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations\nof the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the\ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the\nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The\nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drllling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of\nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using\nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend\nthe terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the\nspacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding\nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well\npad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site\nif the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.\nNOTIFY NDIC INSPECTOR RICHARD DUNN AT 701-770-3554 WITH SPUD & TD INFO.\nCompany !Telephone Number\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC (281) 404-9562 FOR STATEI U SE ONLY\nAddress 0\nReceived\nDX\nApproved\n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500\nIZip\nCity !State Code Date November 04, 2014\nHoust.on TX 77002\nSi / ~ ' t .

The approval is granted on the\ncondition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries\nand 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30 T153N R100W. Tool\nerror is not required pursuant to order.\nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be\nmaintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-\nback whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the\nentire location. OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety\nRegulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28\n(Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any\nproducing well or oil tank.” OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554\nprior to location construction.\nDrilling pit\nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion\noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and\nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized\nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director\nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.”\nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines\nAny changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional\nplan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10082’E.\nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)\nOperators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit\non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following\npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn\naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and\nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,\nthe applicant should retain the permit.\nPermit Fee & Notification\nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that notification be given\nimmediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The\nfollowing information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and\ntime of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-\n8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.",

The Commission is very\nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.\nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the\nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations\nare conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an\nauthorized facility. Such containers must be:\n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container\n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container\n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container\nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but\nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.\nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01\nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production\nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste\nManagement. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the\nsolid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,\ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.\nThank you for your cooperation.\nSincerely,\nBruce E. Hicks\nAssistant Director",
