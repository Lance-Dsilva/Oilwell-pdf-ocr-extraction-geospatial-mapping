The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the east \n& west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Sections 2 & 11-T153N-R101W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS:   PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN WHILE DESIGNING THE FRAC \nJOB FOR THE DAHL 15-11H WELL AS TO NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SM ENERGY \nLINDVIG 1-11HR WELL.  Due to river adjacent to th e well site, a dike is required surrounding the \nentire location. Also, a Closed Mud System may be required, although the disposal of drill cuttings is \ncontingent upon site specific conditions to be de termined by an NDIC Field Inspector.  SM ENERGY \nCO must contact NDIC Field Inspector Kevin Connors at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card.  It is re quested that notification be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, \nBismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, \ndrilling contractor, company repr esentative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. \nand 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Ti me. Our telephone number is (701) 328- 8020, leave a message if after hours \nor on the weekend.  \n \n \n ",

However, the director \nmay require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Ce rtified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov\n. \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \n \nConfidential status \n Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is \nhereby granted.  Such information, except production runs , shall remain confidential for six months commencing \non the date the well is spud. \n Confidential status notwithstanding,  the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well \nrecords wherever located. Your company personnel, or  any person performing work for your company shall \npermit the Director and his representa tives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or \ncontrolled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to \nhave access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field pers onnel periodically inspect \nproducing and drilling wells.  Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time \nupon request.  The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and \nshall be available only to the Commission and its staff. \n \nDrilling pit \n Please be advised approval for use of a drilling reserve pit or drill cuttings pit on this site is contingent on \nsite specific conditions and special pit closure requirements may apply. \n \nSurface casing cement \n Tail cement utilized on surface ca sing must have a minimum compressi ve strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of \ncement can be determined in every well in which producti on or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma \nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elev ation of the well bore.  All logs must be submitted as \none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director.  Image \nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced \nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create  a solution and establish a standard format for industry to \nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a \nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its \nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an \nemail sent to digitallogs@nd.gov\n   Thank you for your cooperation.  \n        \n       Sincerely,  \n \n       D a v i d  T a b o r   \n       Engineering Technician IV ",
