The Kline Federal 5300 11- 18 2B  is a horizontal , Middle Bakken  \nMember well drilled by Xtreme rig #21 (Figure 1).  The lateral section consists of one west to \neast trending, 9,932’ long wellbore penetrating underneath Lake Sakakawea.  The surface, \nvertical and curve sections were previously drilled, and this evaluation will consist of primarily \noperations and observations made during the lateral section. \n \nENGINEERING \n \nThe Kline Federal 5300 11- 18 2B surface, vertical and curve sections were drilled earlier in \n2015 by separate drilling rig.  Xtreme 21 returned to location in May of 2015 to drill the laterals \nof the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B, 3T, 2B, and re-entered the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B \non May 30, 2015."

This assembly drilled to 15,484’ MD where a trip was \nmade due to low penetration rates.  Another complete assembly drilled to 17,597’ MD, where \nat 23:30 CDT on June 2, 2015 the wellbore  made contact with the upper B akken shale at \n17,540’ MD, 10,766’ TVD (-8,698’).  A sidetrack was initiated at 17,420’ MD, using the same \nassembly, and successfully kicked off.  After the sidetrack, drilling continued to 20,149’ MD \nwhere another trip was made due to slowing penetration rates.  A new motor was picked up \nand the well later reached  its total depth at 20,450' MD, at 08:45 CDT on June 6, 2015, \ngenerating an exposure of 9,568’ linear feet of 6 ″ hole through the Middle Bakken Member. \nThe bottom hole location lies 111.86’ south & 9, 932.10' east of surface location or \napproximately 1,071.86' FNL & 296.01’ FEL, NE NE Section 17, T153N, R100W. \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nLithology \n \nSunburst Geology, Inc. was not present for the vertical and curve  sections, therefore no \nlithology is discussed prior to the Middle Bakken Member. \n \nMiddle Bakken Member  \n \nThe Middle Bakken Member was penetrated  at 10,882’ MD, 10,727’ TVD ( -8,659’). The \nmiddle member in this locality is generally composed of a light gray-brown to light gray, very \nfine to fine grained, moderately to well cemented, calcite cemented silty sandstone. It was \napparent that samples observed higher in the member were often light brown, off white  to \ncream colored, while the lower portion of the member was predominantly darker, gray-brown. \nThroughout the lateral, trace amounts of both disseminated and nodular pyrite were observed.  \nSamples also displayed  trace, poor to fair  intergranular porosity  and trace spotty and \noccasionally even, light brown oil staining (Figure 2). \n  \n \nFigure 2. Middle Bakken silty sandstone, observed in the upper portion of the target interval."

      "text": "Geosteering \n \nThe potential pay zone for the Kline Federal 5300 11- 18 2B  was identified by evaluating \ngamma data collected while drilling the Oasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11 T2, \nand the steering practices from the Oasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B. The target \nwas determined to be 12’ thick, and located 12’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and 20’ above \nthe Lower Bakken Shale. The Middle Bakken Member displayed gamma counts ranging from \n70 to 140 (API). The target was identified by having a higher gamma marker at the very top of \ntarget, moderate markers throughout the target zone and a cool marker at the base (Figure 3). \nDespite a single, upper shale strike, geologists were successful in exposing 9,568' of potentially \nproductive Middle Bakken Member the well bore. The well was within the targeted zone for \n67% of the lateral.   \n \n \nFigure 3 . Gamma characteristics observed throughout the Middle Bakken  \nMember while drilling the Oasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11 T2. \n \nShale Strike Summary \n \nAt measured depths  16,750’ through 16,820’ , erratic high  gamma counts were logged. This \nhigh count anomaly was interpreted as being the warm gamma associated with being near the \ntop of target.  Given the well bore was descending at inclinations ranging from 88.9º to 88.2º \n(16,750’ through 16,820’), it was anticipated that this higher gamma would repeat as the well \nbore leveled off or slowly rose in zone. As the wells descent was controlled and the inclination \nraised above 90º (~17,050’ MD), the dip profile displayed the well bore being ~3’ from the top \nof target (13.5’ from base of UBS).  From this point forward the well  bore slowly rose in \nsection and geologists did not see any great concern with the well bore position, given that we \nhad yet to see any warm gamma signatures associated with the top of target . In addition, a \nmajority of the wells within this two-section corridor, drilling east, had a synclinal feature after \nthe halfway point of the lateral.  Between the surveys at 17,395’ and 17,489’  MD, the \ninclination increased from 89.9º to 91.7º. While sliding down to correct the ascending \ninclination gamma counts rose. It was at this time that decision to stop and circulate a bottoms-\nup was made. Samples from the bottoms up confirmed the Upper Bakken Shale had been \ncontacted."

      "text": "Gas and Oil Shows  \n \nHydrocarbon shows at the beginning of the lateral were relatively low.  During the first ~1,500’ \nof lateral operations the well  bore remained primarily near the base if not below the target \nzone. While drilling this interval background gasses rarely exceeded 1 ,000 units, but \nconnection, survey and slide gasses regularly exceeded 1,000 units.  Oil show throughout this \nperiod of drilling was moderate, with most cuttings reacting slowly with a pale yellow diffuse \ncut fluorescence. As the well  bore reached the top of the target  interval hydrocarbon shows \nincreased.  These brief periods of higher gas shows occurred three times while drilling along \nthe upper portion of the target zone (12,250’- 12,510’ MD, 13,200’-13,950’ MD, and 16,300’-\n16,430’ MD) (Figure 4) .  Although these optimistic shows were intermittent, samples \ndisplayed a more promising oil staining that that observed in lower samples. Samples along \nthe upper portion displayed a light to medium brown even oil staining. Fluorescent cuts were \nalso slightly more promising than those observed lower in zone were. Cuts were described as: \nmoderate, pale yellow, streaming cut fluorescence. While drilling from 11,510’ to 11,656’ MD \nthere were issues with the gas detection, this caused low gas readings. When the s ystem was \nrepaired, gas shows immediately climbed.  For the remainder of the well, despite of the well \nbeing high or low in zone, background gasses were low (400-1,200 units) , while connection \ngasses occasionally exceeded 1 ,300 units. Unfortunately, due to heavy contamination from \nlubricants there were no cuts performed after 14,950’ MD. Although hydrocarbon shows \nremained consistent despite of position within the target zone, the most promising oil staining \nremained in the upper most portion of the target interval.  \n \n \nFigure 4.

A few key points: \n1) We will move the rig to the Carson SWD pad once we have finished drilling the vertical portions of all 3 wells on \nthis pad. \n2) We will finish drilling the vertical portion of the third well, the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B, on April 9th . \n3) We will utilize a 2\"d rig to drill the lateral portions of the 3 wells on this pad. \n4) The 2\"d rig is currently drilling wells on a different pad and is scheduled to reach TD on the final well in late \nMay/early June, leaving a gap of approximately 55 days. \n5) We will be able to return to the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 pad on or before June 6th . \nGiven the time sensitive nature of this request, expedited review of these sundries would be greatly appreciated . \nThank you for your consideration , \nMichael P.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E.
