It is re quested that notification be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, \nBismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, \ndrilling contractor, company repr esentative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. \nand 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Ti me. Our telephone number is (701) 328- 8020, leave a message if after hours \nor on the weekend.  \n \n   Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directio nal Surveys) states in part (that) the survey \ncontractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  \nSurveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in  a form approved by the di rector. However, the director \nmay require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Ce rtified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov\n. \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \n \nConfidential status \n Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is \nhereby granted.  Such information, except production runs , shall remain confidential for six months commencing \non the date the well is spud. \n Confidential status notwithstanding,  the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well \nrecords wherever located. Your company personnel, or  any person performing work for your company shall \npermit the Director and his representa tives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or \ncontrolled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to \nhave access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field pers onnel periodically inspect \nproducing and drilling wells.  Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time \nupon request.  The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and \nshall be available only to the Commission and its staff. \n \nDrilling pit \n Please be advised approval for use of a drilling reserve pit or drill cuttings pit on this site is contingent on \nsite specific conditions and special pit closure requirements may apply. \n \nSurface casing cement \n Tail cement utilized on surface ca sing must have a minimum compressi ve strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of \ncement can be determined in every well in which producti on or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma \nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elev ation of the well bore.  All logs must be submitted as \none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director.  Image \nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced \nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create  a solution and establish a standard format for industry to \nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a \nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its \nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an \nemail sent to digitallogs@nd.gov\n   Thank you for your cooperation.  \n        \n       Sincerely,  \n \n       Nathaniel Erbele  \n       Petroleum Resource Specialist ",
