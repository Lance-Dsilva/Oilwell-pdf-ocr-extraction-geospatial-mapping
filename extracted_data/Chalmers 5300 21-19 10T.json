The Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T is a horizontal Three Fork s well within \nthe Williston Basin consisting of one 9,444' uncased lateral drilled toward the east . The vertical \nhole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,341’. The curve  would be built at 12 degrees \nper 100’ to land within the Three Forks . This well is a two section lateral which originates in the  \nnorthwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the southeast quarter of section 20. \nDirectional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the Three Forks \nreservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock."

Offset well control was essential in curve operations, t o \nsuccessfully land within the Three Forks . Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray \nsignatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in \norder to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical de pth (TVD) was \nperiodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Charles Formation  [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged  8,537' MD 8,536 ' TVD        \n(-6,460' SS).  Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation co nsisted of a limestone  \nmudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was microcrystalline, \nfirm-friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity, as was rare \nspotty light brown oil stain Occasionally noted was a  dolomite mudstone, which was light \nbrown, light gray brown in color. It was microcrystalline, friable -firm, laminated, with an earthy \ntexture. Also noted was a trace of intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil \nstain. Rarely noted was anhydrite, which was off white  and cream in color. It was soft, \nmicrocrystalline, and massive with an earthy to amorphous texture. Following connections or \nperiods of non-circulation, gas peaks of 32 to 77 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of \n24 to 103 units.   \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged  9,436' MD 9, 435' \nTVD ( -7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown, gray brown, trace dark gray  in color. The lime mudstone  \nwas predominately friable to firm, with an  earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some intervals \ncontained a trace of black -brown algal material , a trace of fossil fragments,  and traces of \ndisseminated py rite. Also present was an \nargillaceous lime mudstone that was described \nas light gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray \ntan, rare off white, trace dark gray  in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately \nfirm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a trace of disseminated \npyrite.  F ollowing connections or periods of \nnon-circulation, gas peaks of  63 to 160 units \nwere noted, as were drilling gas shows of 89 to \n294 units.  Rare intercrystalline porosity was \nnoted as well as traces to occasional spotty light \nbrown oil stain was occasionally observed while \nlogging the Mission Canyon Formation.\n \nFigure 2.

The RP M directional drillers , Ryan  MWD’s, and Sunburst Consulting \npersonnel worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering \ndecisions to maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of \npenetration (ROP) of the formation.  \n \nThe 805’ curve first drilled 44’ in 1 hour before a MWD failure caused it to be tripped out of the \nhole and the MWD replaced. The remainder of the curve was drilled  in 25 hours with a bottom \nhole assembly (BHA) consisting of bit #5/re-run #4, a Smith MDI516 PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 \ndegree fixed NOV 7/8 5.0 motor. The curve was successfully landed at 11,140’ MD and 10,834’ \nTVD, approximately 20’ into the Three Forks  Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP -110 \ncasing was set to 11,118’ MD.  \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T and surrounding control wells  had \nestimated formation dip to be approximately 0.5º down to the TD of the lateral.  The preferred \ndrilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T consisted of a eleven foot zone located \napproximately sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma \nray data, and sample observations  were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred \nstratigraphic position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, \nprojected porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  \n \n \n \nFigure 9.

If the well-bore moved toward the \nbottom of the target zone, the moderate gamma was observed. As the well -bore moved lower in \nformation, the higher gamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence \nof claystone in coll ected samples.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 & 20 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the \nentire location.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-\n770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to  bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, us ed and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authoriz ed representative of the director prior to lining and use.   \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilize d in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 9972’ east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Ce rtified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directio nal well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n Tail cement utilized on surface ca sing must have a minimum compressi ve strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a su ite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and qua lity of cement can be dete rmined (Standard CBL or Ul trasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs ma y be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov    \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n        \n       Sincerely,  \n \n       Nathaniel Erbele  \n       Petroleum Resource Specialist"

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E.
