Lewis Federal 5300 21- 31 5B; May 2019, McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota (All photos by Dillon Johnson unless noted otherwise). \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 21- 31 5B is located in Baker Field of the Williston \nBasin [Lot 2 Section 31, T153N, R101W]. The subject well lies approximately 8 miles south of the town \nof Williston, in McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is the first \nof two wells to be drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 pad. This pad is set up as a 1,280 acre laydown \nspacing unit, with 500’ N/S and 100’ E/W drilling setbacks. The subject well is permitted to drill east from \nthe surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well consists of a single Middle Bakken Member \nlateral, targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect p orosity and fracture trends enhancing \nreservoir quality. \nEngineering Operations Overview \n \nThe 13 3/8” surface casing for the subject well was preset at a depth of 3,325’ prior to Nabors B21 arrival. \nNabors B21 reentered the subject well on April 16, 2019. Due to the presence of several salt water disposal \nwells in the immediate area the decision was made to set a 9 5/8” isolation casing string through the Inyan \nKara and into the Swift. The isolation portion was drilled without issue to a depth of 6,097’. The 9 5/8” \ncasing was then set to set to a depth of 6,077’. The remainder of the vertical hole was completed with two \n8.75” assemblies. The first vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 8,4 85’ before being replace due to low \nROP, the second vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 10,270 ’ (KOP).  While drilling in the Mission \nCanyon, at a depth of 9,821’ the driller noticed that the mud volume was increasing. A flow test indicated \nthat the well was taking on water. A cement bond log will be run at a later date, but as of this report, it is \nassumed that the cement job on the 9 5/8” casing string was poor and lead to water from the Inyan Kara \nflowing into the wellbore. To resolve the water flow for the time being, the drilling choke was engaged to \nincrease pressure on the back side of the drill pipe and hold back the water flow. From 9,821’-10,270’ ~350 \npsi casing back pressure was maintained to reduce the water influx."

      "text": "The curve assembly consisted of a Reed TKC56 PDC bit (#4), attached to a 2.38 ° NOV mud motor and \nScientific Drilling MWD tools drilled to a depth of 11,148’ (casing point). At a depth of 11,325’ while \nattempting to slow ly reduce flow with the drilling choke, the choke was accidently closed completely \nresulting in a dramatic increase in pressure. Shortly after this incident fluid losses we observed at a \nsubstantial rate. It is assumed that with the increase in pressure the Mission Canyon began to absorb fluid. \nFrom this depth to casing point there was a substantial amount of LCM pumped down hole. To keep the \nLCM in the drilling fluid the shaker screens were removed and not used until cement operations for the 7” \ncasing began. The curve w as successfully landed at 1 1,148’ MD and 1 0,786’ TVD, approximately 12’ \nbelow the Upper Bakken Shale on April 25, 2019. Seven inch diameter 32# P-110 intermediate casing was \nset to 11,130’ MD at landing.  \n \nThe lateral was completed using two 6” assemblies. The first lateral assembly drilled to a depth of 15,739’ \nbefore a trip was required due to an MWD failure.  Prior to the MWD failure the decision was made to \nsidetrack due to the potential proximity to the Upper Bakken Shale (please see details below in the \nGeosteering portion of this report). The sidetrack was kicked off on the first attempt, at a depth of 15,620’. \nWhile replacing the faulty MWD tool , the bit and mud motor were also replaced. The second lateral \nassembly drilled the remainder of the lateral.  The Lewis Federal 5300 21- 31 5B reached a total depth of \n20,860’ on May 3, 2019.\n \nOffset Control \n \nOffset well data can be found in the  ‘Control Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well s were \nessential in providing control, making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and curve landing \ntarget depth. The three primary offsets were, The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal \n5300 11-31 4BR, the Oasis Petroleum North America , LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H , and the Oasis \nPetroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B. By referencing the gamma signature of these \noffsets and using formation thicknesses, a model was formed for the target interval pinpointing a strategic \nlanding.  Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in these offset wells were compared to \ngamma data collected during drilling operations in to successfully land the curve. \n \nGeology \n \nSample evaluation began in the Otter Formation  at 8,300’ measured depth (MD). Lagged samples were \ncaught by Sunburst personnel in 30’ intervals through the vertical and curve, and 50’ intervals in the lateral. \nRock samples were evaluated under wet and dry conditions using a stereo zoom binocular microscope for \nthe identification of lithology including the presence of porosity and oil.  Only observed prospective intervals \nare described here, but detailed lithological descriptions for all formations are provided in the ‘Lithology’ \nappendix.  \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group] was logged at 9,473' MD, 9,466’ TVD \n(-7,309' MSL). The Mission Canyon Formation is described as cream, \ntan, light gray, and light brown gray in color. Samples are \npredominately m icrocrystalline and are a firm mudstone . The \nlimestone has an earthy, rarely crystalline texture.  Also noted in in \nseveral samples were trace fossil fragments. The limestone is \nargillaceous in part throughout this interval. In certain areas possible \nintercrystalline porosity was noted but there was no significant oil \nstaining observed in samples . Throughout the Mission Canyon gas \nshows are promising, with an average background gasses ~360u with \nseveral connection gasses exceeding 1000u . It should be noted that \nprior to the drilling choke being used to hold ~350psi casing back \npressure, gas show was  much higher  (~510u background gas)  than \nthose observed with the casing back pressure (135u background gas).  \nFigure 2.

Entry into this member is characterized by high gamma  counts (>300 API), elevated background \ngas and increased rates of penetration.  While drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale  gas a background \ngas of 580u was  observed , as well as several  gas shows exceeding 800u. The distinct black shale is \ncarbonaceous and petroliferous, as well as, hard and platy. Minerals including disseminated/nodular pyrite \nand trace calcite fracture fill was observed.  \n \nThe Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was \nentered at 11,020’ MD, 10,774' TVD (-8,617' MSL). Samples in \nthe Middle Bakken are predominantly a light brown, light brown \ngray, light to medium gray, silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is \nfine to very fine grained, and firm. The Middle Bakken typically \ncontained sub-round to sub-angular grains. Samples are smooth, \nmoderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare to trace \nquantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite is  present as was \ntrace to fair  intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium \nbrown, spotty oil stain was visible in many of  these samples. \nWhile drilling the Middle Bakken background gasses ranged from \n~700 to 3500 units while several shows exceeded 4500u. \n \nFigure 3. Wet sample cuttings of silty sandstone from the Middle Bakken. \n \nGeosteering \n \nStructure maps provided by Oasis Petroleum projected the structure would have an overall  down dip \naveraging -0.50º. Below are the two nearest offset wells to the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B. The Lewis \nFederal 5300 11-21 4BR (Figure 4), drilling west to east, ~0.30 miles north of the subject well, and the \nLewis Federal 5300 31-31H ( Figure 5 ), drilling west to east, ~0.20 miles south of the subject well. \nAlthough the nearby offsets all had an overall dip rate of -0.50º , the structure near a vertical section of \n4,700’ varied considerably. The Lewis Federal 5300 31- 31H has a very consistent downward dip rate of \napproximately -0.50 throughout the course of the lateral. While t he Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR has a \nconstant downward dip rate until ~4,700’ vertical section, where the structure abruptly dips down at a steep \n>2º for several hundred feet before flattening, reversing to a steep >1.5 º up dip for several hundred feet, \nthen returning to dip rate more similar to that of regional structure. In total the synclinal structure observed \non the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR lasted for ~1,950’. The steering team recognized that if the structure \non the subject well was to be irregular, and similar to the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR, that this irregular \nstructure would be observed from 4,000’-7,000’ vertical section."

Prior to drilling out of the 7” casing it was determined that the C marker  near the center of \ntarget and the featureless D marker in the lo wer portion of the Middle Bakken were to be the primary \nsteering guides throughout the course of the lateral ( Figure 6). For the first ~3,200’ of the lateral the \nstructure observed was similar to regional structure, with dip rates of -0.15º to -0.85º being calculated. As \nthe wellbore ascended above the target interval at ~18,300’ it became apparent that the structure was \ndipping down at a steep >1º rate. While drilling ahead the possibility of the structure dipping down at >2 º \nwas anticipated. As the MWD data collected from the survey at 15,651’ was analyzed it was realized that \nthe structure had begun to dip down at a very steep >2º angle. At this time the steering teams profile placed \nthe wellbore at the top of the target interval.

At the time of the stop card there were no drilling parameters that would indicate \nan Upper Bakken Shale strike, and a bottoms up sample did not d isplay any shale. When the data was \nassessed it was determined that the structure could possibly be dipping down at -2.35º, and that the wellbore \ncould be as close as 1’ from the Upper Bakken Shale. To avoid a potential shale strike Oasis Petroleum \ndecided that the safest course of action would be to pull back to a depth of 15,620’ and begin a sidetrack. \nAs the sidetrack was being troughed the MWD tool failed and a trip was required. After the required trip \nthe wellbore was successfully sidetracked on the f irst attempt. After the sidetrack the structure continued \nto dip down at a steep -1.4º to 2.3º until a MD of 16,125’. From a MD of 16,125’ - 16,960’ the structure \nappeared to be relatively flat before turning up-dip for ~500’. In total the irregular synclinal structure was \nobserved for ~3,150’ MD of drilling. This structure should be anticipated if  more wells are to be drilled \nwithin the DSU in the future. Aside from a brief 340’ \nwhen the wellbore ascended above the target interval, \nthe wellbore drilled within the target interval from the \nsidetrack point to 20,860’ TD. Over the course of the \nlateral, gamma markers throughout the target interval \nwere relatively inconsistent and difficult to interpret. \nTwo of the more dependable steering guides were a \ncool marker above the target interval, and a relatively \nwarm marker near the top of the target zone. Although \nthe cool was semi -consistent, due to the close \nproximity to the Upper Bakken Shale, it was not used \nas a primary steering guide. The warm marker ~4’ \nfrom the top of the target interval was a good \nreference for the wellbore’s position within the \nmember but  was not consistently observed while \ndrilling in the upper portion of the target interval.  \nRegardless of position in zone the assembly regularly \nbuilt inclination on rotation. There did not appear to \nbe any noticeable hard streaks or intervals that were \nmore or less favorable in relation to ROP. \n \nFigure 6. Target definition for the Oasis Petroleum, Lewis \nFederal 5300 21-31 5B. \n \nThe Lewis Federal 5300 21- 31 5B  had an estimated overall formation dip  of approximately -0.54º. \nPenetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore \nin the preferred stratigraphic position within the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis \nrepresentatives, the target interval was deter mined to maintain adequate distance from the shale and used \nas preferred drilling areas.  \n \nThe lateral was drilled in less than  5 days from casing exit to total depth, with two  lateral assemblies. A \ntotal depth of 20,860’ MD was achieved at 05:20 hours on May 3, 2019. The wellbore was completed 95% \nwithin target, opening 9,730’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially productive \nreservoir rock. \nHydrocarbon Shows \n \nGas was continuously recorded from 8,300’ to the completion of the lateral, along with the monitoring of \nfree oil at the possum belly and shakers. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained \nnear balance, this allowed gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. During the vertical, gas shows \nranging from 10 to 1860 units were noted, against a 10.10 to 10.95 pound per gallon (PPG) diesel-invert, \nmud weight. Due to water influx from the Inyan Kara, casing back pressure was utilized from 9,821’ to"

      "text": "Summary \n \nThe Lewis Federal 5300 21- 31 5B  is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member \ndevelopment program, in the Indian Hill  prospect of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was \ndrilled from surface casing to total depth in 17 days. Due to the wellbore proximity to the Upper Bakken \nShale a sidetrack was utilized at a depth of 15,620’. A total depth of 20,860’ M D was achieved at 05:20 \nhours on May 3, 2019.  The well -site team worked together to maintain the wellbore in t he desired target \ninterval for 95% within target, opening 9,730’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. \n  \nSamples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly silty sandstone. These samples are light brown, \nlight brown gray, light to medium gray silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very fine grained. The \nmiddle member typically contained sub-round and occasionally sub-angular grains. Samples are smooth, \nmoderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare  quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite are \npresent as was trace to fair intergranular porosity . Trace to rare light-medium brown, spotty oil stain was \nvisible in many of  these samples. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon shows were \nencouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member. \n \nThe well should be regarded as an engineering and geological success based on the combination of: \n \n• Maximum exposure to the target \n• Minimal days from re-entry to total depth \n• No shale strikes \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B awaits completion operations to \ndetermine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.  \n \nRespectfully,  \nDillon Johnson \nLead Geologist & Geosteerer  \nSunburst Consulting, Inc.  \nMay 3, 2019"

Oasis Intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a \nsmall drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the \nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations \nof the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the \ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the \nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The \nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drllling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of \nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using \nan Initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not Intended to alter or extend \nthe terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the \nspacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding \nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well \npad is located In a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1).

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 31 & 32 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to a drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding \nthe entire location.  Effective June 1, 2014, a covere d leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock \ndisposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site \nduring clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration op erations are conducted.  OASIS \nPETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector  Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location \nconstruction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to  bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, us ed and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authoriz ed representative of the director prior to lining and use.   \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilize d in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 10084 E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

      "text": "April 9, 2014 \n \n \n \n   RE:  Filter Socks and Other Filter Media \n    Leakproof Container Required \n    Oil and Gas Wells \n \nDear Operator, \n \nNorth Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 stat es in part that all waste material associated with \nexploration or production of oil and  gas must be properly di sposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all \napplicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. \n \nFiltration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota.  The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, No rth Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid w aste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E. Hicks \n  Assistant Director"
