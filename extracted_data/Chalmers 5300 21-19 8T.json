Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting) \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T [Lot 2  Section 1 9, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of W illiston in McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21 -19 8T is a horizontal Three Forks well within the \nWilliston Basin consisting of one 9, 358' lateral drilled toward the east . The vertical hole was \nplanned to be drilled to approximately 10,341’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ \nto land within the Three Forks . This well is a two  section l ateral which originates in the  \nnorthwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of section 20. \nDirectional drilling technologies and geo -steering techniques were used to land in the Three \nForks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. \n \n ",

Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to \nsuccessfully land within t he Three Forks . Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray \nsignatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in \norder to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was \nperiodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \nThe Charles Formation  [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,534' MD 8,533 ' TVD         \n(-6,457' SS).  Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone  \nmudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was microcrystalline, \nfriable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity, as was rare spotty \nlight brown oil stain. Occasionally noted was a dolomite mudstone, which was light brown, light \ngray brown in color. It was microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also \nnoted was a trace of intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely \nnoted was anhydrite, which was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and \nmassive with an earthy to amorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non-\ncirculation, gas peaks of 68 to 113 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 82 to 138  \nunits.   \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,431 ' MD 9, 430' \nTVD ( -7,354' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown, gray brown, trace dark gray  in color. The l ime mudstone \nwas predominately friable to firm, with an  earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some intervals \ncontained a trace of black -brown algal material , a trace of fossil fragments,  and traces of \ndisseminated pyrite. Also present was an a rgillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light \ngray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray  in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a t race of disseminated pyrite.  Following connections or periods of \nnon-circulation, gas peaks of 101 to 114 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 143 to \n249 units.  Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light \nbrown oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. \n \n \nFigure 2.

The RP M directional drillers and MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel \nworked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to \nmaximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of \nthe formation.  \n \nThe 875’ curve was drilled in 23.5 hours with a bottom hole assembly  (BHA) consisting of bit \n#4, a Smith MDI516 PDC bit, attached to a 2.3 8 degree fixed NOV 7/8 5.0 motor and MWD \ntools. The curve was successfully landed at 1 1,185’ MD and 10,833’ TVD, approximately 20’ \ninto the Three Forks  Formation.

The preferred drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T consisted of a ten foot \nzone located approximately seventeen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Penetration rates, gas \nshows, gamma ray data , and sample o bservations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the \npreferred stratigraphic position in the target zone. Using offset  well data  provided by Oasis \nrepresentatives, projected porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.  \n \n \n \nFigure 9.

The low gamma (D) in the middle of the target zone was often utilized to establish the \nwell-bore’s position in the target zone. If the well -bore moved toward the bottom of the target \nzone, the moderate gamma of marker (E) was observed. As the well -bore moved lower in \nformation, the higher gamma of the underlying claystone (F) was observed, as was the presence \nof claystone in collected samples.

The well \nsite team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 87% of the \nlateral, opening 9,358’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. \n \nSamples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown-\ntan, occasional cream, trace light gray brown  in color. It was very fine crystalline, firm, \nlaminated, with a microsucrosic texture . Occasional disseminated pyrite was noted as was \noccasional intercrystalline porosity. Also noted was occasional spotty to trace even light brown \noil stain . Also observe d was light green -light gray green, light gray blue  shale that was firm, \nsubblocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible \nintergranular porosity.  \n \nGas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T varied according to stratigraph ic position and penetration \nrates which may have reflected increased porosity.  The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were \nencouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks.  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Section 19 &20 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location.  Effective June 1, 20 14, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-\n3554 prior to location construction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to  bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, us ed and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authoriz ed representative of the director prior to lining and use.   \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilize d in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 9972’ east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.
