Services provided \nin\ncluded; morning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample \nexamination, sample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, \ngeo steering, sample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well \nreport. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur offset GR TVD logs were from the Wade Federal 5300 21F30H well, located on the \nsa\nme well pad as Wade Federal 5300 41F30 9B. Within the Middle Bakken, the primary \nobjective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter layering \nbetween dolomitic siltstone and limy sandstones. Gamma patterns were compared with \nthe offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in \nthe targeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from \nrelevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine \nour position within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder.  The \nma\njority of the well was drilled within the target area of the Middle Bakken.   \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.\n2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft \nwh\nile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HClF, alizarin red and \nca\nlcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp.   \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsy\nstem uses an infraFred detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S, \nO2 and CO2.  \n ",

      "text": "The Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and nonFdispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturallyFoccurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant reFcalibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, openFhole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed. \n \n3.0 GEOLOGY\n \n \n3.1 Formation Tops Formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify markers in the \ncu\nrve and lateral (Table 3.1).  \nFORMATION TOPS \nFormation/Marker Beds ACTUAL Prognosis \nVertical Section Top MD (ft) Top TVD (ft) TH ICKNESS (ft) Difference (ft) TVD KB/DF(ft) \nTVD\nSS \n(ft) \nKibbey Lime 8344 8344 148 -2 8342 -6266 \nCharles Salt 8492 8492 684 9 8501 -6425 \nBase Last Salt 9176 9176 209 -16 9160 -7084 \nMission Canyon 9385 9385 549 -10 9375 -7299 \nLodgepole 9934 9934 731 -11 9923 -7847 \nFalse Bakken 10785 10665 9 -15 10650 -8574 \nUpper Bakken Shale 10808 10674 19 -11 10663 -8587 \nMiddle Bakken 10868 10693 ~41 -15 10678 -8602 \nMiddle Bakken (Top of Target) 10868 10709 11 -19 10690 -8614 \nMiddle Bakken (Base of target) 10868 10720   -19 10701 -8625 \nLower Bakken Shale         10714 -8638 \nTable 3.1 Wade Federal 5300 41-30 9B Formation Tops \n \n3.2 Lithology \nSample analysis began at 8,000’ MD in the Otter Formation.   \n \n3.3 Formation Dip \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.5ο.   \n \n3.\n4 Shows \nThe verticalFbuild section was drilled with invert mud and the lateral was drilled with \nbrine/production water.

The approval is granted on the \ncondition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be located approximately down the east-west axis (500’ drilling corridor, \nper Commission policy) and no closer than 200 feet to the east or west boundary within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of  Sections \n29, 30, 31 & 32 T153N R100W.  Tool error is not required pursuant to order. \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be \nmaintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, a nd must remain on-site during cl ean-out, completion, and flow-\nback whenever filtration operations are conducted.  Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding t he \nentire location.  OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC mu st take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety \nRegulation) when contemplating simultaneo us operations on the above captioned location.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 \n(Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable electric lighting generato r, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any \nproducing well or oil tank.”  OASIS PE TRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 \nprior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and comp letion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and recl aimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an autho rized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.   Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed dir ectional \nplan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 561’S.   Also, based on the a zimuth of the \nproposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 1061’S and 10042’E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilli ng permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day followin g \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be b y sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude  that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drillin g permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .T he permit fee has been received.  It is requested that notifica tion be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The \nfollowing information must be included:  Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and \ntime of spudding.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E.
