The primary pay zone was approximately\n20’ under the base of the Pronghorn member of the Bakken formation. This pay zone was picked\nfor its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well\nwithin the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. MWD services were\nperformed by Schlumberger/Pathfinder and Directional services were provided by RPM. Heather\nA. Coutts, Jake Robertson and Dylan E. Fowler were the primary well site geologists; providing\ngeo-steering and mud logging from Columbine Logging, Inc.\nWell Information\nAPI #: 33-053-05998 Field: Baker\nSpud Date: 09/01//2014 TD Date: 11/18/2014\nSurface Location: 877' FSL & 280' FWL SEC 30, T153N, R100W, McKenzie County, North Dakota.\nIntermediate Casing Point: 647’ FSL & 878’ FWL; SEC 30; 11,124’ MD, 10,777.96’ TVD\nBottom Hole Location: 547’ FSL & 162’ FEL; SEC 29; 20,530’ MD, 10,881.61’ TVD\nSurface Elevation: 2045’ KB: 2070’\nCasing Shoe: 11,124’ MD, 10,778’ TVD Total Depth Drilled: 20,530’\nOperator: Oasis Rig: Patterson 488\nCompany man: Tyler LaClaire, Well-site Geologist: Heather Coutts, Jake Robertson,\nBob Brown Dylan E.

Services provided included;\nmorning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample examination, sample\nrecording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, geo steering, sample\ncollection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well report.\n2.1.1 Geosteering\nOur offset GR TVD logs were from the Wade Federal 5300 41-30 8T2 well, located on the same\nwell pad as Wade Federal 5300 41-30 7T. Within the Three Forks 1st Bench, the primary\nobjective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter layering between\nlimy sandstones and siltstone. Gamma patterns were compared with the offset log and a TVD log\nwas created while landing the curve to in order to land in the targeted zone. Steering in the\nlateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant gamma markers, as well as by using\nlithology, total gas and ROP to determine our position within the formation.\n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys\nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder. The majority of\nthe well was drilled within the target area of the Three Forks 1st Bench.\n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.)\n2.2.1 Sample Examination\nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft while\ndrilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous content,\nstructure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. Carbonate\nidentification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and calcimeter. Hydrocarbon\nfluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV lamp.\n2.2.2 Gas Detection\nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection system\nuses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates and measures\ngases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit equals 100 ppm. The gas\ndetection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, iC4, nC4, H2S, O2 and CO .\n2\nThe Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing\ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection. The system uses\na proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to 10,000 gas units. This\ntranslates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon gas mixtures. Calibration is\nperformed using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibration",

Complete immunity\nto saturation or damage in the presence of high concentrations of both light and heavy\nhydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of constant re-calibration or zero referencing. This\nallows the Bloodhound to react to hydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration\nwithout dilution.\nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump output, open-\nhole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and bottom hole\nassembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations and adjustments\nwere made when necessary.",

The oil-based mud contributed a background gas of 200-300 units, and\nsaturated cuttings with oil, making all cuttings in the vertical show the same cut and\nfluorescence. Gas shows were around 2000+ units during the drilling of the lateral.\n3.5 Oil Shows\nInvert mud was used in the vertical, masking any oil shows.

The approval is granted on the\ncondition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries\nand 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of SECTIONS 29 & 30 T153N R100W.\nTool error is not required pursuant to order.\nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be\nmaintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-\nback whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the\nentire location. OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety\nRegulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28\n(Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any\nproducing well or oil tank.” OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554\nprior to location construction.\nDrilling pit\nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion\noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and\nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized\nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director\nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.”\nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines\nAny changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional\nplan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 377’S and\n10042’E.\nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)\nOperators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit\non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following\npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn\naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and\nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,\nthe applicant should retain the permit.\nPermit Fee & Notification\nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that notification be given\nimmediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The\nfollowing information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and\ntime of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-\n8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.",

Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a\nform approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the\nsurvey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one\nadobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.\nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.\nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90\nfeet in the lateral.\nSurface casing cement\nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement\nutilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.\nLogs\nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones\ncan be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the\npresence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production\nor intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as\none digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a\nstandard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov\nThank you for your cooperation.\nSincerely,\nAlice Webber\nEngineering Tech",

      "text": "April 9, 2014\nRE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media\nLeakproof Container Required\nOil and Gas Wells\nDear Operator,\nNorth Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with\nexploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all\napplicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\nFiltration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very\nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.\nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the\nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations\nare conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an\nauthorized facility. Such containers must be:\n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container\n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container\n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container\nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but\nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.\nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01\nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production\nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste\nManagement. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the\nsolid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,\ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.\nThank you for your cooperation.\nSincerely,\nBruce E. Hicks\nAssistant Director",
