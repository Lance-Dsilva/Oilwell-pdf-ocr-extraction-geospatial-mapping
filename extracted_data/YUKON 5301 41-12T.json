Yukon 5301 41-12T [SW SW Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is \nlocated approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The \nYukon 5301 41-12T is a horizontal Three Forks devel opment well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s \nCamp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to \napproximately 10,335’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the Three \nForks. This well is a two section lateral which or iginates in the southwes t quarter of section 12, \nthen drilled south across section 13, to the southwest quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional \ndrilling technologies and geo-steer ing techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks \nreservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock."

This well \nwas drilled to the Three Fork s landing of 10,794’ MD in August and September of 2012. The \nformation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis Petroleum \nNorth America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE NE Section 12, T153N, R101W] were used to \nassist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the \noffset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing was \nperiodically updated to ensure acc urate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are \nincluded as an appendix to this report."

This \ninformation network provided depth, drilling rate , pump strokes and total gas units to multiple \nareas throughout the well site. Gas data was fed from Sunburst’s di gital gas detector, a total gas \nchromatograph, through Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon constituents (C 1 through C4) \nwere recorded in part-per-milli on concentrations. Gas sampling was pulled through ¼” polyflo \ntubing after agitation in Sunburst’s gas trap at the shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at \nthe direction of the well site geologists. Samples were collected at 30’ intervals in the \nvertical/curve and 30’ intervals in the lateral.  Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry \nconditions under a 10x45 power binocular microsc ope (for detailed lithol ogic descriptions see \nappendix). Cuttings were sent to North Dakota Ge ologic Survey. In addition to rock samples, \nrate of penetration and gamma ray data were also used in geologic analysis to aid geo-steering \nand dip calculations.  \n \nLithology \n \nFormation analysis began at 8,240 ’ MD with a siltstone and anhyd rite characteristic of the \nKibbey Formation [Mississippian Big Snowy Group]. This in terval consisted of an earthy, red to \norange, red brown, light orange to off white, trace light brow n, friable siltstone that was \nmoderately calcite cemented with an earthy texture. The Kibbey “Lime”  was logged at 8,366' \nMD 8,365' TVD (-6,246') (SS). This marker is represented by an  off white anhydrite which was \nmicrocrystalline, soft, massive, and amorphous. The anhydrite is often accompanied by slower \npenetration rates as the bit tran sitions out of the overlying silt stone. The rate of penetration \n(ROP) then increases as the bit exits the anhydrite  cap to this marker and enters the underlying \nlimestone mudstone to wackestone. This carbonate  was described as a lig ht gray light gray \nbrown, off white lime mudstone which was microcry stalline, friable, and dense with an earthy \ntexture. Samples in the lower section consisted of  red to orange, red brown, light orange to off \nwhite, trace light brown, friable and blocky siltstone with calcite cemen t moderately cemented. \nThis facies was interbedded with soft, off white amorphous or microcrystalline anhydrite.  \n \nThe Charles Formation  [Mississippian Madison Group] cons isted of salt, anhydrite, limestone \nand argillaceous lime mudstone. The first Char les salt was drilled at 8,508' MD 8,507' TVD (-\n6,338') SS. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) was logged at 9,214' MD 9,212' TVD (-7,093') SS as \nindicated by slower penetration rates and increased weight on bit.  The beds of salt within the \nCharles Formation can be identified by an incr ease in penetration rates and lower API gamma \ncount rates. Samples of the sa lt intervals were described as  frosted, translucent, anhedral to \nsubhedral, with no visible poros ity. Slower penetration rates were observed as the bit \nencountered sections of light brown, gray brown,  gray, gray brown lime mudstone which was \nfriable to firm and dense, with an  earthy texture. This limestone was argillaceous in part in areas \nwhere gamma API counts were elevated, and contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. No visible \noil stain was noted. In areas wh ere the penetration rates were  slowest anhydrite was logged. \nThese samples were described as off white, light  gray, soft, massive and amorphous. Within the \nCharles Formation at 9,126’ MD slower penetra tion rates indicated the presence of anhydrite."

      "text": "After exiting intermediate casing the well-bore onsite personnel attempted to steer the well-bore \ndown to the low gamma portion of the drilling zone to attempt to establish dip. After multiple \nencounters with tight streaks which moved the well-bore’s inclination above 90 degrees the \ndirectional drillers were able to position the well-bore in the lower gamma area of the drilling \nzone.  At this point the target z one was revised to an 8 foot drilling zone located sixteen feet into \nthe Three Forks Formation. The revised plan was implemented to avoid deflections from \nmultiple tight streaks located high in forma tion, and to take advantage of the low gamma \nprimarily dolomitic facies which proved useful for steering decisions. Steering decisions from \nthis point were made by using the higher gamma,  of the claystone, the low gamma located in the \nmiddle to higher portion of the drilling zone, an d the fluctuating high to medium gamma located \nat the top of the drilling zone.  \n \nAt 20,573’ MD while taking a check shot to determine the well-bore inclination, spiking \ndifferential pressure shut down the pumps. It wa s determined that the well-bore had entered the \npronghorn formation at 20,530’ MD, which was causing the hole to pack off. Working the pipe \nand pumping cleared the hole enough to take a su rvey at 20,573’ MD with  a survey depth of \n20,520’, which showed an inclination of 91.5 º. A previous check shot at 20,535’ MD and a \nsurvey depth of 20,482’ show ed an inclination of 90.5 º; a difference of 1 º change in inclination \nover 38’ while rotating.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within \nthe 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 1 & 12. Tool error is not required pursuant to order \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the disposal \nof drill cuttings is contingent upon site specifi c conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field \nInspector.  A perimeter dike is required along th e north & east sides of the location.  OASIS must \ncontact NDIC Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction. \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The maximum legal coordinate from the well head at casing \npoint is: 150W.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well \nhead is: 9952S & 150W. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit ca rd .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend."

Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Ce rtified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \n \nReserve pit \n Please be advised that conditions  may be imposed on the use and reclam ation of a drilling reserve pit on \nthis site if specific site conditions warrant. \n \nSurface casing cement \n Tail cement utilized on surface ca sing must have a minimum compressi ve strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of \ncement can be determined in every well in which producti on or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma \nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elev ation of the well bore.  All logs must be submitted as \none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director.  Image \nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced \nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files.  To create  a solution and establish a standard format for industry to \nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a \nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file.  The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its \nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy diskette, a standard \nCD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov    \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n        \n       Sincerely,  \n \n       T o d d  L .
