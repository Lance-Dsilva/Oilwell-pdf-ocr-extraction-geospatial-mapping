The top of the \nPERMIAN-MINNEKAHTA FM Formation is picked from logs at 7433 feet. In lieu of an immediate cement \nsqueeze, approval may be granted (via Form 4 Sundry Notice) to monitor the surface-production casing \nannulus. Approval will be contingent upon the following stipulations: \n1. The surface-production casing annulus must be continuously monitored with an accurate \npressure gauge, the pressure gauge must not be any higher than a 300 psi gauge. \n2. All valves installed on the annulus must be exposed to the surface; burial will be allowed only in \nthe presence of an Oil and Gas Division inspector. \n3. Any pressure development on the annulus must be immediately reported to the Oil and Gas \nDivision \n4. The PERMIAN-MINNEKAHTA FM Formation must be isolated, as directed by the Oil and Gas \nDivision, upon the abandonment of the well, remedial action may be required prior to \nabandonment if warranted by the Director. \nSince the Dakota Group is not properly isolated, OASIS PETRO NO AMER must run a frac string \nprior to performing a Hydraulic Fracture Simulation per North Dakota Administrative Code Section \n43-02-03-2 7 .1 \nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. \nSincerely, \n4?~ \nGeologist \nrsd/ras \n600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701)328-8020 Fax (701)328-8022"

The primary pay \nzone extended from 12’-21.5’ below the top of the Middle Bakken. This pay zone was \npicked for its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to \nsteer the well within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. \nDirectional drilling was performed by RPM and MWD services were performed by Ryan \nDirectional Services.

Services provided included; \nmorning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample examination, \nsample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, geo steering, \nsample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well report. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur primary offset GR TVD log was the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 13T well, located \n66’ north on the same pad.  From this offset log the Middle Bakken was determined to be \napproximately 34’ feet thick.  Within the Middle Bakken, the primary objective was to \nstay within an 9.3’ thick target window within the Middle Bakken “B” unit, which \nextended from 7’ to 21.3’ below the top of the Middle Bakken.  The target window was \nbetween 12’ and 21.3’ below the top of the Middle Bakken.  Gamma patterns were \ncompared with the offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in \norder to land in the targeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating \ndip from relevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to \ndetermine our position within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Ryan Directional Services.  The \nupper 7’ of the Middle Bakken, referred to as the “C” unit, consisted of overall low \ngamma compared to the “B” and “A” units.  The lowest gamma readings of 80 api were \njust below the Upper Bakken Shale.  The base of the “C” was marked by a gamma peak \nof approximately 120 api.  \nThe “B” unit extended from 7’ to 21.3’ below the upper shale. The upper portion of the \n“B” consisted of three gamma peaks of varying intensity and thickness, and the lower ten \nfeet had relatively lower gamma, with some inconsistent spikes and lows.  The peaks in \nthe upper portion of the “B” had a maximum value of 145 api, and the lows in the lower \nportion were as low as 65 api.   \nThe “A” unit was expected to extend from 21.3’ to 34’ below the upper shale, based on \nan offset Three Forks well on the same pad.  The 12B wellbore never dropped into the \n“A”, but based on offset data the gamma was expected to be relatively high, and steady.  \nThe base of the “A” had a thin clean section of gamma, followed by the Lower Bakken \nShale.  After landing the curve, the wellbore was drilled almost entirely within the “B” \nunit."

      "text": "4 \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2.2.1 S\nample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft \nwhile drilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and \ncalcime\nter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp.   \n \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsystem uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, H2S, \nO2 and CO2.  \n \nThe Blo\nodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, open-hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed."

The projected bottom hole \nlocation is: SE SE SEC 32, T153N, R100W, 581.88' FSL & 331.53' FEL, McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota, with aprojected TVD of 10,881.77’. \n \nThe targeted pay zone for the wellbore was a window within the Middle Bakken “B” \nunit, and bounded above and below by lower gamma zones.  This window extended from \n12’ to 21.5’ below the top of the Middle Bakken. The anticipated dip of the formation \nwas 0.6 degrees down overall, with a possibly dip reversal structure between 15000’ MD \nand 17000’ MD.  Anticipated dip was based on a subsurface structure map provided by \nOasis Petroleum, and nearby laterals. Our primary offset GR TVD log was from the \nGramma Federal 5300 41-31 13T, located on the same pad, 66’ to the north. From this \noffset log the Middle Bakken was determined to be approximately 34’ feet thick \n \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.58 degrees.  The anticipated dip reversal was not \nencountered, but we did see a flattening to 89.9 degrees between 16150’ and 16600’.  Gas \nreadings and oil shows were best in the upper 2’-3’ of the Middle Bakken “B”.   \n \nCurrently the well is awaiting completion. \n \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nMatthew Lorraine, Aleks Kozakowski, Well-Site Geologists \nColumbine Logging, Inc. \n9844 Titan Ct.

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a \nsmall drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the \nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations \nof the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the \ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the \nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The \nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of \nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using \nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not Intended to alter or extend \nthe terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the \nspacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding \nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well \npad ls located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1).

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a \nsmall drllllng rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the \nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations \nof the surface casing. Once the surface casing ls cemented, a plug or mechanical seal wlll be placed at the top of the \ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the \nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drllling and casing plan as per the APO. The \nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of \nSection 43-02-03·55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using \nan initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but Is not Intended to alter or extend \nthe terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the \nspacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03·31 requirements regarding \nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well \npad Is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03·19 & 19.1).

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within \nthe 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 31 & 32, T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  Also, Tool error is not required pursuan t to order.  Lastly, OASIS PETRO NO AMER must \ncontact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to  bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, us ed and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authoriz ed representative of the director prior to lining and use.   \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilize d in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 147’ S, 10016’ E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.
