The primary pay zone was approximately \n20’ under the base of the Pronghorn member of the Bakken formation. This pay zone was picked \nfor its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well \nwithin the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. MWD services were \nperformed by Schlumberger/Pathfinder and Directional services were provided by RPM. Heather \nA. Coutts, Miles R. Wentland and Dylan E.

      "text": "2.0 SERVICES \n \n2.1 Well site Geology (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \nGeological consulting and mud logging started on 12/26/2014. Services provided included; \nmorning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample examination, sample \nrecording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, geo steering, sample \ncollection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well report. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur offset GR TVD logs were from the Wade Federal 5300 41F30 7T well, located on the same \nwell pad as Wade Federal 5300 41F30 4T. Within the Three Forks 1\nst Bench, the primary \nobjective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter layering between \nlimy sandstones and siltstone. Gamma patterns were compared with the offset log and a TVD log \nwas created while landing the curve to in order to land in the targeted zone.  Steering in the \nlateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant gamma markers, as well as by using \nlithology, total gas and ROP to determine our position within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder/Ryan.  The \nmajority of the well was drilled within the target area of the Three Forks 1\nst Bench.   \n \n2.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.)\n \n \n2.2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft while \ndrilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous content, \nstructure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. Carbonate \nidentification was determined with 10% dilute HCl\nF, alizarin red and calcimeter. Hydrocarbon \nfluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV lamp.   \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection system \nuses an infraFred detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates and measures \ngases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit equals 100 ppm. The gas \ndetection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, iC4, nC4, H2S, O2 and CO2.  \n \nThe Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and nonFdispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The system uses \na proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to 10,000 gas units.  This \ntranslates as 0 to 100% typical naturallyFoccurring hydrocarbon gas mixtures.  Calibration is \nperformed using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibration \ngases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, and 100% pure methane.

      "text": "5.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION \n \nWade Federal 5300 41F30 4T is a East lateral Three Forks 1st Bench well located in SEC 30, \nT153N, R100W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary pay zone was 20’ under the \nbottom of the Pronghorn member of the Bakken formation. This pay zone was picked for its \nproduction potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well within the \ndefined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state.  \n \nThe primary objective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter \nlayering between limy sandstones and siltstones. Gamma patterns were compared with the offset \nlog and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in the targeted zone.  \nSteering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant gamma markers, as \nwell as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine our position within the formation. \n \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.25\nο. Refer to Figure 4.1 on page 6 for a detailed \nformation dip profile.  \n \nAs Per Brendan Hargrove, Oasis Operations Geologist: \nThe well landed at 10791’ TVD, ~6’ into the Claystone. In the first few hundred feet of the \nlateral, we continued downFsection deeper into the Claystone as we attempted to get our INC up. \nWe reFentered the Three Forks at ~11600’ MD and slowly traversed up to the top of our target \nwindow, near the “C” marker. The “C” marker had abundant pyrite, and the bit seemed to not \nwant to react to downslides from this position. We were getting good ROPs, though, so we \ndrilled ahead in the top of target for ~2000’. Around 15500’ MD, bed dips began shallowing out \nas expected based on offset data, and we traversed down section, encountering the Claystone \nagain at ~17000’ MD. We drilled ~200’ of Claystone, then quickly rose back up into the top of \nthe target window again (“C” marker) and drilled ahead to TD. As mentioned above, we suffered \na motor failure late last night at 20193’ MD, ~400’ from our planned TD. The question of \nwhether it was worthwhile to trip and drill the remained of the lateral was discussed, and it was \ndetermined that we would call TD slightly early. \n \nCurrently the well is awaiting completion. \n \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nHeather A.

The \nundersigned states that this request for suspens ion of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of \nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using \nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend \nthe terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oll and gas lease with acreage in or under the \nspacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding \nconfidential ity pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well \npad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1 ). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site \nif the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig . \nCompany 'Telephone Number \nOasis Petroleum North America , LLC (281) 404-9562 FOR STATE USE ONLY \nAddress \n1001 Fannin , Suite 1500 D Received I \nD Approved \nCity ' State IZip Code \nHouston TX 77002 \nDale \nS~11,ap.ne / \n<) Prin1ed Name \n•• . > ... \n}~/, .,,£~/ \n, \n\"\"'° Lauri M.

The approval is granted on the \ncondition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cemen t, be no closer than the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries \nand 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30 T153N R100W.  Tool \nerror is not required pursuant to order. \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS:  Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-p roof container (with placard) fo r filter sock disposal must \nbe maintained on the well site beginning when the well is sp ud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and \nflow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted.   OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into \nconsideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when cont emplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned \nlocation.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be \nplaced nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank.”  Due to drainage ad jacent to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 \nprior to location construction.   \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and comp letion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and recl aimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an autho rized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.   Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed dir ectional \nplan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 10082’E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilli ng permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day followin g \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be b y sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude  that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drillin g permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .T he permit fee has been received.  It is requested that notifica tion be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telepho ne.  The \nfollowing information must be included:  Well name, legal loca tion, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and \ntime of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (7 01) 328-\n8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend."

Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a \nform approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completio n if the \nsurvey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.

The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, No rth Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid w aste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.
