Nabors Drilling rig B22 at the Oasis Petroleum Kline Federal  5300 31-18 6B; April, 2015 McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31- 18 6B  [ Lot 3 Section 1 8, \nT153N, R100W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This \nsection lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake \nSakakawea in McKenzie County . The   Kline Federal 5300 31- 18 6B is a horizontal Mid dle \nBakken well, in a double -section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east  from the \nsurface location within Sect ion 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom -hole \nlocation (PBHL) in that section . There are 500’ setbacks along the north and south borders  and \n200’ setbacks from the e ast and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well \nconsists of one  Middle Bakken lateral . The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to \napproximately 10,221’. The curve would be  built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the \nMiddle Bakken. Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land \nin the Middle Bakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the  ideal target rock.  Oasis Petroleum \nis targeting a silty sandstone  facies of the Middle Bakken with intent to intersect porosity and \nfracture trends enhancing reservoir quality. \n \nOFFSET WELLS \n \nOffset well data used for depth correlation during curve oper ations are found in the ‘Control \nData’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data, \nmaking it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By \nreferencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for t he target interval \n",

Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in \nthese wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to \nsuccessfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically \nupdated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,391 ' MD 9, 390' \nTVD ( -7,357' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown  to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray  in color. The lime \nmudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an  earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some \nintervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of \ndisseminated pyrite. Also present was an a rgillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light \ngray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray  in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite.  Gas shows were not  present. Rare \nintercrystalline porosity was noted as well  as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the \nMission Canyon Formation. \n \nThe Upper Bakken Shale [ Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation ] was drilled at 10,866' \nMD 1 0,676' TVD ( -8,643' SS) . Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, \nelevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black  to black gray  \ncarbonaceous and petroliferous  shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy  texture. Fracture \nporosity was noted, and t race minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite \nfracture fill. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 4,577 units of \ndrilling gas. \n \nThe Middle Bakken [ Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,926 ' MD \n10,693' TVD ( -8,660' SS)  which was -6’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Kline Federal \n5300 31-19 8B. The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in a predominately 16 \nfoot zone beginning 12 feet below the Upper Bakken Shale. Samples in the Middle Bakken were \npredominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-medium brown, occasional light gray \nbrown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained, firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, \nsmooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately cemented . A trace of disseminated and \nnodular pyrite was noted as was occasional  intergranular porosity. Also noted was common light \nto medium brown spotty to even oil stain.  \n \n                        \n \nFigure 2 & 3.

Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples \nwere continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic  conditions were maintained \nnear balance, t his allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas varied \naccording to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected increased \nporosity. During the vertical, gas peaks o f 23 to 75 units were noted, against a 9.4-10.2 lb/gal \ndiesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral  ranged from 100 to 4,100 \nunits, against a 9.57-9.6 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid . Connection peaks of 3,000 to 5,000 \nunits were observed, as were drilling gas shows of 500 units to 5,690 units coinciding with the \nbest shows. Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, ethane, propane \nand butane characteristic of Middle Bakken Member gas.   \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

      "text": " \n \nFigure 6. Offset Well Target Definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).   \n \nSteering decisions were made by using  gamma markers identified by Oasis representatives. The \nhigh gamma (C) in the central portion of the drilling zone was useful in identifying the well-bore \nplacement in formation . The slightly lower gamma (between B & C) was observed as the well -\nbore moved to the top of  the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well- bore moved \nhigher, out of the target zone . Low gamma in the middle of the target zone  (D) was noted as the \nwell-bore moved to the middle of the target zone. Samples collected when drilling below the \ntarget zone tended to have a greater concentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone than \ndid the samples collected when the well -bore was higher in the target zone. This lateral wa s \ndrilled in 4 days from casing exit to TD, with one necessitated trip at 11,936’ for a MWD tool \nfailure at which time the bit was replaced. Well site teams worked  closely together with \ndirectional to maximize penetration rates averaging 200 to 280 feet per hour while rotating, \nresulting in 2 days of over 3,000’ of lateral progress. The well site team was able to keep the well \nbore in the desired target the entire well with the exception of approximately 800’ at 17,850’ \nwhen the wellbore was drilled below t he preferred target interval.  The TD of 20,597’ MD was \nachieved at 23:30 hours CS T April 15, 2015. The wellbore was  completed with  92% of the \nlateral in target, opening 9,489’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion)  of potentially \nproductive reservoir rock.

      "text": "SUMMARY  \n \nThe Kline Federal 5300 31- 18 6B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle \nBakken development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface  casing to TD \nin 12 days. The TD of 20,597’ MD was achieved at 23:30 hours CS T April 15, 2015. The well \nsite team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 92% of the \nlateral, opening 9,489’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.  \n \nSamples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light -\nmedium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray  in color. It was  very fine grained, \nfirm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately \ncemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular \nporosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.  \n \nGas on the Kline Federal 5300 31- 18 6B  varied according to stratigraphic position and \npenetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity.  The overall gas and hydrocarbon \nshows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Middle Bakken. \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31- 18 6B  awaits completion \noperations to determine its ultimate production potential.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nMichelle R.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted. Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the \nentire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must co ntact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-\n770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to  bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, us ed and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authoriz ed representative of the director prior to lining and use.   \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilize d in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 10051’ east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E.
