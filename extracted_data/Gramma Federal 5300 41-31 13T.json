The primary pay \nzone extended from 13’-24’ below the top of the Three Forks. This pay zone was picked \nfor its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the \nwell within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. \nDirectional drilling was performed by RPM and MWD services were performed by Ryan \nDirectional Services.

Services provided included; \nmorning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample examination, \nsample recording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, geo steering, \nsample collection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well report. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur primary offset GR TVD log was the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 31T well, located \n33’ south on the same pad.  From this offset log the Three Forks was determined to be \napproximately 26’ feet thick.  Within the Three Forks, the primary objective was to stay \nwithin an 6’ thick target window within the Three Forks “A” unit, which extended from \n13’ to 26’ below the top of the Three Forks. Gamma patterns were compared with the \noffset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in the \ntargeted zone.  Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant \ngamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine our \nposition within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Ryan Directional Services.  The \nupper 13’ of the Three Forks, referred to as the “B” unit, consisted of overall high gamma \ncompared to the “A” unit.  The highest gamma readings of 170 api were just above the \ntarget line.  The top of the “A” was marked by a gamma peak of approximately 120 api.  \nThe “A” unit extended from 14’ to 26’ below the upper shale. The upper portion of the \n“A” consisted of lower gamma readings of 55 – 85 api. \nThe “A” unit was expected to extend from 14’ to 26’ below the top of the Three Forks, \nbased on an offset Three Forks well on the same pad.  The 13T wellbore dropped into the \nclaystone, confirming the basic thickness of the zone.  The base of the “A” had a clean \nsection of gamma, followed by the Claystone 1.  After landing the curve, the wellbore \nwas drilled almost entirely within the “B” and “A” units."

Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous \ncontent, structure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. \nCarbonate identification was determined with 10% dilute HCl-, alizarin red and \ncalcimeter. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV \nlamp.   \n \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection \nsystem uses an infra-red detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates \nand measures gases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit \nequals 100 ppm. The gas detection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, IC4, NC4, IC5, \nNC5, H2S, O2 and CO\n2.  \n \nThe Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The \nsystem uses a proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to \n10,000 gas units.  This translates as 0 to 100% typical naturally-occurring hydrocarbon \ngas mixtures.  Calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) traceable calibration gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, \nand 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity to saturation or damage in the presence of \nhigh concentrations of both light and heavy hydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of \nconstant re-calibration or zero referencing. This allows the Bloodhound to react to \nhydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration without dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump \noutput, open-hole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and \nbottom hole assembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations \nand thereby adjust lag time when needed."

The \nwell was drilled to completion at 17:30 hours, 3/02/2015.  The projected bottom hole \nlocation is: SE SE SEC 32, T153N, R100W, McKenzie County, North Dakota, with a \nprojected TVD of 10,932.98’. \n \nThe targeted pay zone for the wellbore was a window within the Three Forks first bench.  \nThis window extended from 13’ to 24’ below the top of the Three Forks. The anticipated \ndip of the formation was 0.5 degrees down overall, with a possibly dip reversal structure \nbetween 16000’ MD and 17500’ MD.  Anticipated dip was based on a subsurface \nstructure map provided by Oasis Petroleum, and nearby laterals. Our primary offset GR \nTVD log was from the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 31T, located on the same pad, 33’ to \nthe south. From this offset log the Three Forks was determined to be approximately 26’ \nfeet thick \n \nThe formation had an average dip of 89.6 degrees.  The anticipated dip reversal was \nencountered. We did see a flattening to 90.1 degrees between 16000’ and 17500’.  Gas \nreadings and oil shows were best in the lower 5’-6’ of the Three Forks “A”.   \n \nCurrently the well is awaiting completion. \n \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \nMark Miller, Adam Harris, Well-Site Geologists \nColumbine Logging, Inc. \n602 S.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within \nthe 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 31 & 32 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  Also, OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must contact NDIC Field Inspector \nRichard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to  bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, us ed and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authoriz ed representative of the director prior to lining and use.   \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilize d in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 10016’ E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E. Hicks \n  Assistant Director"
