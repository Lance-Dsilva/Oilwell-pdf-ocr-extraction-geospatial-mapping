Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting) \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 6B [Lot 2  Section 1 9, \nT153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of W illiston in McKenzie \nCounty, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 6B is a horizontal Middle Bakken  well within \nthe Williston Basin consisting of one 9,503 ' lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical hole was \nplanned to be drilled to approximately 10,271’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ \nto land within the Middle Bakken . This well is a two  section lateral which originates in the  \nnorthwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of section 20. \nDirectional drilling technologies and geo- steering techniques were used to land in the Middle \nBakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock."

      "text": "OFFSET WELLS  \nOffset well data used for depth correlation during curve oper ations are found in the ‘Control \nData’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to \nsuccessfully land within the Middle Bakken. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray \nsignatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during d rilling operations in \norder to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was \nperiodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nThe Charles Formation  [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,535' MD 8,534 ' TVD ( -\n6,458' SS).  Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone  \nmudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, off white  in color.

Occasionally noted was a dolomite mudstone, which was light brown, light \ngray brown in color. It was microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture.

The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was \ndescribed as light gray, light brown, gray brown, trace dark gray  in color. The lime mudstone  \nwas predominately friable to firm, with an  earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some intervals \ncontained a trace of  black-brown algal material , a trace of fossil fragments,  and traces of \ndisseminated pyrite. Also present was an a rgillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light \ngray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray  in color. The \nargillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture. \nSome intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite.   Following connections or periods of \nnon-circulation, gas peaks of 51 to 1,414 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 31 to \n117 units. Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light  \nbrown oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation. \n \n                                  \n  \nFigure 2.

Later in the lateral the well -\nbore moved below the target zone, and marker (E) was noted as was higher trending gamma \nindicating that the well- bore was moving lower toward marker (F).

The \nwell site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 66% of \nthe lateral, opening 9,503’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. In the later part of the lateral \nto avoid unnecessary doglegs it was decided not to steer the well-bore into the target zone for the \nsole purpose of regaining the target zone.  \n \nSamples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was descr ibed as light-\nmedium brown, trace tan- light gray brown, trace gray  in color. It was  very fine grained, firm -\nfriable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement  moderately \ncemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was n oted as was common intergranular \nporosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.  \n \nGas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 6B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration \nrates which may have reflected increased porosit y. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were \nencouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Middle Bakken. \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Section 19 &20 T153N R100W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location.  Effective June 1, 20 14, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for \nfilter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must \nremain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are \nconducted.  OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contac t NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-\n3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to  bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, us ed and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authoriz ed representative of the director prior to lining and use.   \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilize d in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum \nlegal coordinate from the well head is: 9971’ east. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the \napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit."

It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend. \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Ce rtified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directio nal well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n Tail cement utilized on surface ca sing must have a minimum compressi ve strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a su ite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and qua lity of cement can be dete rmined (Standard CBL or Ul trasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs ma y be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov    \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n        \n       Sincerely,  \n \n       Nathaniel Erbele  \n       Petroleum Resource Specialist"

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E. Hicks \n  Assistant Director"
