Nabors B22 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Colville 5301 44-12T \nduring July and August, 2013 in the Baker Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota. \n(G. Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting) \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colville 5301 44-12T [SE SE Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is \nlocated approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The \nColville 5301 44-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s \nCamp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to \napproximately 10,333’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the Three \nForks. This well is a two section lateral which or iginates in the southeast quarter of section 12, \nthen drilled south across section 13, to the southeast quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional \ndrilling technologies and geo-steer ing techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks \nreservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. \n \nOFFSET WELLS  \n \nThe primary offset wells used for depth correla tion during curve operations  were the Gulf Oil \nExploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C; a nd the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC \nAsh Federal 5300 11-18T. The Gulf Oil Explor ation and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C [SE SE \nSec. 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately ½ of a mile west of the Colville 5301 44-12T. \nThis well was completed in March of 1982 reached  a total depth of 13,800’ true vertical depth \n(TVD).

Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-\n110 casing was set to 11,144’ MD.  \n \nGeologic structure maps of the Colville 5301 44- 12T and surrounding contro l wells, estimated \nformational dip to move down at approximately -0.3 º initially, then reverse due to a plunging \nsyncline at about 2,500’, reve rsing to an estimated 0.5 º  to 1.0º  until total depth (TD) was \nreached.  The Colville 5301 44-12T preferred drilling interval consisted of an eight foot zone \nlocated approximately sixteen feet into the Thr ee Forks Formation. Strati graphic position in the \ntarget zone was based on penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ra y data and sample observations. \nThe projected target landing was to be sixteen feet into the Three Forks and was successfully \nreached prior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, projected \nporosity zones were identified as the preferred drilling areas (Figure 9)."

      "text": "SUMMARY  \n \nThe Colville 5301 44-12T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Three Forks \ndevelopment program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 21 \ndays. The TD of 21,090’ MD was achieved at 1720 hours CDT August 12, 2013. The well site \nteam worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 76% of the \nlateral, opening 10,141’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. \n \nDiesel invert drilling fluid 9.5-10.1 ppg for the vertical hole and 10.15-10.4 ppg for curve \noperations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt \nintervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.  \n \nSamples in the Three Forks were commonly dol omite which is tan, cream, occasional light \nbrown, rare light gray tan, trace light gray. Additionally this facies was friable and dense with an \nearthy texture. It also contained a trace of  disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible \nintercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a  rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain . \nPresent in varying amounts was light gray to of f white, rare light green shale which was friable \nto firm, sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Tr ace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted, \nand the shale contained no visible porosity. \n \nGas on the Colville 5301 44-12T varied according to  penetration rates and stratigraphic position \nof the well bore. Observed concentrations of  background gas ranged from 300 to 600 units, and \nconnection peaks of 1,000 to 1,200 units were observed in the middle portion of formation while \ndrilling in the lateral where shows were the be st. A trip at 19,527’ MD, yielded a trip gas of \n1,545 units \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Colv ille 5301 44-12T awaits completion operations \nto determine its ultimate production potential.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \nG.

The \ncasing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43..02..03-21. No \nsaltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the sulface casing Is \ncemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting \nInto the well. A rig capable of drilling to TO will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to \ncomplete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of \ndrilling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43.02..03·55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to \ntake advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an Initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to \ndrill a well to total depth but Is not Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation \nunder, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well.

The \napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than \nthe 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the \n1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Section 13 & 24 T153N R101W.  \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into \nconsideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safet y Regulation) when contemplatin g simultaneous operations on \nthe above captioned location.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable \nelectric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed  nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil \ntank.”  Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.  \nIn cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an o ff-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided \naffirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pa d agrees to accept burial on their property of the \ncuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an  offsite spacing/drilling unit.  OASIS PETRO NO \nAMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to  bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well \ndrilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, us ed and reclaimed in a manner that will \nprevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits \nare prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authoriz ed representative of the director prior to lining and use.   \nDrill cuttings and solids must be stabilize d in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings \npit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  \nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location.  The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing \npoint is: 450’ south.   Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximu m legal coordinate from the \nwell head is: 10570’ south."

If circumstances require operations to \ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may \nbe waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information \nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other \ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the \ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit ca rd .The permit fee has been received.  It is requested \nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the \nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.  The following information must be included:  Well name, legal \nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.  Office hours are \n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a \nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.  \n \nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells \n   NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor \nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.  Surveys \nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may \nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the \noperation of the director's office in a timely manner.  Ce rtified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe \ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.    \nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.  \nSpecifically, the Horizontal and Directio nal well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve \n(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral. \n \nSurface casing cement \n Tail cement utilized on surface ca sing must have a minimum compressi ve strength of 500 psi within 12 \nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi \nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.   \n \nLogs \n NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a su ite of open hole logs from which formation tops and \nporosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and \n(3) a log from which the presence and qua lity of cement can be dete rmined (Standard CBL or Ul trasonic cement evaluation \nlog) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.  \nAll logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log \nASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs ma y be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to \ndigitallogs@nd.gov    \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n        \n       Sincerely,  \n \n       Nathaniel Erbele  \n       Petroleum Resource Specialist"
