The Missouri River continues to rise and the possibility of additional \nflooding from the spring melt and recent rains in the near future exists. I urge you to closely monitor \nthese sites and take the necessary preventative actions to eliminate or mitigate environmental damage \nif these sites become deluged with flood waters . The following e-mail from Allen Schlag of the National \nWeather Service also addresses the current situation of the Missouri River in the Williston area: \n600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck , North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (70 1)328-8020 Fax (701)328-8022"

      "text": "From: Allen Schlag [mailto:allen .schlag@noaa.gov] \nSent: Monday, May 12, 2014 1:47 PM \nTo: WILLIAMS; Samuelson, Jerry O.; MCKENZIE; Anton, Amy J.; Ackerman, Laura C.; Engelhardt, Bruce \nW.; Travnicek, Andrea J.; Johnson, Sean M. \nSubject: Missouri River \nGreetings everyone \nJust a quick note on the Missouri River near Williston forecast site and the prospects for problems as \nwe go forward into latter half of May and early June {by default this also includes the Yellowstone in \nND as well). As you may have noticed already, the Missouri River near Williston crossed over into \nForecast Issuance Stage this past weekend before falling back below 20 ft. This, is temporary. While \nthe Corps released a statement last week tempering their runoff expectations for the Missouri River \noverall, the attached graphic of mountain snowpack suggests we still have a pretty strong runoff into \nthe Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers ahead of us. \nWe will most likely cross over above flood stage as measured at the Lewis and Clark Bridge west of \nWi lliston at some point in the next couple of weeks. \nWhat exactly lies in store for the area with respect to eventual river stages is still quite unclear as the \noverall environment for the melt of the mountain snowpack is too far out. However ... there has been \na fairly wet pattern in the plains of Montana already this spring, with a mixed bag in the upper \nelevations of centra l MT. The region remains well above norma l with respect to mountain snowpack, \nbut is also well below where 1997 and 2011 were at this point in time {see the second attached pdf). \nIf I had to take a wild guess this far in advance, something around the 22.5 to 24.5 ft range is \nreasonable, with any added big rains this could be expanded quite easily to the 25-26 ft range. \nHow exactly this will compare to this spring's ice jams and high water is a really good question, which I \ndon't have any easy answers to either . Suffice to say, I think there's a pretty decent chance that we \nwill see water roughly 4-6 ft higher than is currently in northwestern ND along both the Yellowstone \nand Missouri Rivers with the timing of near the last week of May to about the third week of June. \nHistorically, I know there have been some access issues with oil well sites in the Trenton area with \nwat er levels in the 22 ft range at the Lewis and Clark Bridge. How much of this has been mitigated by \nring dikes or road raises, again ... very good question to which I have no answer. \nOf course, if you have any questions or just want to chat about this in greater detail, always feel free \nto give me a call. \nAlle n \np.s. And as always, feel free to disseminate as you feel is appropriate. \nAlle n J. Schlag Service Hydrologist \nWFO-Bismarck \nNati onal Weather Service \n2301 Univ.
