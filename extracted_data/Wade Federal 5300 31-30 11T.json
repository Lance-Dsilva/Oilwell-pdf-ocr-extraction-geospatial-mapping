The \nhorizontal well was reentered  on December 12, 2014 and represents a continuation of  Oasis \nPetroleum’s development of the Three Forks  Formation within Baker  Field. The Wade Federal \n5300 31-30 11T was planned to drill an approximately 9,612’ lateral along a proposed azimuth \nof 86.92°. The well bore will be enhanced for production by multistage fracture stimulation. \n \nOFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION \n \nThe Oasis Wade Federal  5300 21- 30 12T [SW NW  Section 30, T153N, R100W ] is located \napproximately 0.33 miles north of the subject well on the same pad as the other two offset wells . \nThe Oasis Wade Feder al 5300 21- 30 12T was spud on the 30th of September 2014. The Oasis \nWade Federal 5300 21 -30 13B was spud on the 26th of September  2014. The Oasis Wade \nFederal 5300 21- 30 14T2 [ SW NW Section 30, T153N, R100W ] was spud on the 28th of \nSeptember, 2014."

A digital gas detector and chromatograph were \ninterfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder system. The unit of measure for gas on this well \nwas units (u), which was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The EDR \nprovided drill rate, on -off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and received \ntotal gas information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were caught \nby the rig crew in 30’ intervals from 4,600’ MD to 10,870’ MD, 10’ intervals from 10,870’ MD \nto 11,080’ MD, and 30’ intervals from 11,080’ MD to 20,500’ TD. Wet and dry cuttings were \nexamined under a tri -ocular microscope and complete lithologic descriptions and sampling \nintervals are provided in the lithology document within this evalu ation. The set of dry cuttings \ncollected during the duration of the well were sent to the State of North Dakota. Evidence of \nlight hydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the gas chromatography \nequipment and documented on the mud log presented with this report. \n \nZones of Interest : \n \nThe Mission Canyon Formation ( Mississippian; Madison G roup) was drilled at 9,364’ TVD       \n(-7,310’) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone followed by  gray to tan earthy \ntextured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon  ranged from 15 to 100 \nunits against 9.8 ppg mud.  \nMap By Clay Hargett \nOasis Petroleum North America"

In general the \nLodgepole can be described as a medium to dark  gray brown argillaceous lime mudstone with a \ncrystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite  (Figure 3). The False Bakken \n(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,648’ TVD (-8,594’), is comprised of very dark brown to black, \nslightly pyritic shale with an earthy texture,  and was found to be  soft to f irm (Figure 4). Strong \nhydrocarbon shows  in the lower 100’ of the Lodgepole were as high as 158 total gas units; \nsuggest that some of the oil and gas from the Upper Bakken Shale may be exploiting fractures  \nthought to exist in the Lower Lodgepole.   \n \nThe Bakken Formation (Devonian – Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and \nlower black, fissile, organic -rich pyritic sh ale, separated by an arenaceous limestone, siltstone \nand silty sandstone middle member. These three members overlay a silty shale or siltstone of the \nPronghorn Member toward the basin depositional center. The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at \n10,656’ TVD (-8,602’) with sample returns typically described as  black, carbonaceous, \npetroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite  (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken, \npenetrated at 10,673’ TVD (-8,619’), consists of a varying thickness and sequence of interbedded \nsiltstone, limestone and silty sandstone.  Trace spotty light brown oil staining was present along \nwith gas shows as high as 456 TGU. This l ight brown spotty oil staining was  common. \nPenetrated at 10,711’ TVD (-8,657’), the Lower Bakken Shale was described as a black to dark \nbrown carbonaceous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite  (Figure 6). Gas shows \nencountered in the Lower Bakken read as high as 1356u (C1-C4). The Pronghorn was penetrated \nat 10,718’ TVD (-8,664’) and is commonly descr ibed as a dark to medium gray siltstone with \ncalcite cement. \n \n \n \nFigure 5 & 6: Wet cuttings of the Upper Bakken Shale (left), Lower Bakken Shale (right) at 10X."

The top of the Three Forks  was drilled at 10,736’ \nTVD (-8,682’) and is comprised of a light to medium gray, cream to off white sucrosic dolomite \nwith trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite  and light green shale also with trace \namounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 8). Shows within the Three Forks Formation ranged from \n50 to 431 units in a drilling mud of 9.6-9.9 ppg. \n \n \n \nFigure 7 & 8: Wet cuttings of the Three Forks dolomite and shale (left and right) at 10X.  \n \nGeo-steering: \n \nKick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the “base last salt” marker \nto the Three Forks  “target” in the offset wells. The Chalmers 5300 31- 30 12T was used as the \nprimary offset through the vertical and c urve sections. While drilling the curve, measured \ngamma ray signatures were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of \nthe curve. The landing target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was \nconsistent with the offset wells. The curve was successfully landed within the Three Forks  \nFormation at a depth of 11,0 80’ MD (10, 753’ TVD) placing the well bore approximately 17’ \nbelow the top of the Three Forks Formation.  Directional tools were then pulled out of the \nhole and a string of 7” casing was set (11,060 ’ MD) and then cemented by Schlumberger.  \n \nSamples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite \ncontent. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample ob servations \nalong with gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided \nso as to obtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run at TD.  \n \nThe Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC prospect geologis t defined the  an initial target  \nzone as an 10’ zone that began 18’ below the top of the Three Forks Formation and ended at  \nthe claystone member 28’ below the Three Forks Formation. The upper target zone consisted \nof a dolomite  and shale  interval reading 90-120 count gamma ( A marker).  The center of the \ntarget interval was comprised  of a warmer  dolomite  with greater amounts of shale  reading \n100-140 count gamma ( B marker). The base of the target zone was characterized by a clean \ndolomite with trac e amounts of shale  with gamma readings of 35-90 (C marker). The A -C \ngamma markers were used for determining depth within the target interval and plotted on the \nWade Federal 5300 31-30 11T dip profile (Figure 10)."

      "text": "Hydrocarbons: \n \nGas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir during \nthe drilling of the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T well. In the invert mud system, hydrostatic \nconditions were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to \nbe monitored. Gas shows were encountered in vertical, curve and lateral drilling of the well.  \n \n Background gas observed during the drilling of the lateral ranged from 50 to 120 units. Invert \ndrilling fluid was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighing 9.8-10.0 ppg. \nThe lateral was drilled with saline drilling fluid with a mud weight of 9. 6-9.9 ppg. Gas shows \nranged up to 438 units and connection gases were observed up to 359  units. C1- C4 gas \ncomponents were observed throughout the course of the lateral. Trip gases were observed as high \nas 1,482 units. Oil shows were very light throughout the lateral ranging from 0 -3% in sample. \nWhen present it was a light brown spotty oil stain that yielded a slow to moderate streaming to \ndiffuse light green cut fluorescence. \n \n \nSUMMARY \n \nThe Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a two- section horizonta l well bore within the \nThree Forks Formation at the Wade Federal 5300 31- 30 11T. A net of 9,52 5’ was drilled within \nthe Three Forks. A mud program consisting of diesel invert ( 9.8 – 10.0 ppg), during the vertical \nand curve build sections, and salt water  based mud (9.6 -9.9 ppg), during the lateral maintained \nstable hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas concentrations.  \n \nProjections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well bore in the Three Forks Formation \ntarget zone for 86% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of  a light to medium gray, \ncream to off white dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and \nlight green shale also with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite . Intercrystalline porosity was \ngenerally seen throughout the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target zone were high \nthroughout the lateral. Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light brown oil stain.  \n \nThe Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T will be fitted with a 4 ½” pr oduction liner and swell packers \nin preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true commercial value of the \nwell. The well currently awaits fracture stimulation. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nHannah Thatcher \nDaniel Haynes \n Sunburst Consulting, Inc. \nJanuary 18, 2015"

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with \nfreshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The \ncasing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Appllcatlon for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No \nsaltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is \ncemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting \nInto the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to \ncomplete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of \ndrilling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to \ntake advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to \ndrill a well to total depth but Is not Intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation \nunder, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis \nPetroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03·31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to \nthis permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC \n43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the \nwell ls not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig. \nCompany \nOasis Petroleum North America LLC \nAddress \n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 \nAssistant \nEmail Address \nccovington oasispetroleum.com \nPrinted Name \nState \nTX \nChelsea Covin ton \nDate \nNovember 3, 2014 \nZip Code \n77002 \nFOR STATE USE ONLY \nD Received ~Approved \nDate \nBy \nTille \nENGINEERING TECHNICIAN"

The approval is granted on the \ncondition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries \nand 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre  spacing unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30 T153N R100W.  Tool \nerror is not required pursuant to order. \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS:  Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-p roof container (with placard) fo r filter sock disposal must \nbe maintained on the well site beginning when the well is sp ud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and \nflow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted.   OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into \nconsideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when cont emplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned \nlocation.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be \nplaced nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank.”  Due to drainage ad jacent to the well site, a dike is required \nsurrounding the entire location.  Remote pit is NOT approved at this time.  OA SIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC \nField Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and comp letion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and recl aimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an autho rized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.   Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed dir ectional \nplan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 9972’E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilli ng permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day followin g \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be b y sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude  that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drillin g permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .T he permit fee has been received.  It is requested that notifica tion be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telepho ne.  The \nfollowing information must be included:  Well name, legal loca tion, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and \ntime of spudding.  Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (7 01) 328-\n8020, leave a message if after hours or on the weekend."

The Commission is very \nconcerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry. \n \nEffective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained  on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the \nwell is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, co mpletion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations \nare conducted.  The on-site container must be used to st ore filters until they can be properly disposed of in an \nauthorized facility.  Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, No rth Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid w aste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E. Hicks \n  Assistant Director"
