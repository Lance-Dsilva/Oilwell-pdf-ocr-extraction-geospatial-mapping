The primary pay zone was approximately \n20’ under the base of the Pronghorn member of the Bakken formation. This pay zone was picked \nfor its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well \nwithin the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. MWD services were \nperformed by Schlumberger/Pathfinder and Directional services were provided by RPM. Heather \nA. Coutts, Jake Robertson and Dylan E.

      "text": "2.0 SERVICES \n \n2.1 Well site Geology (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \nGeological consulting and mud logging started on 10/03/2014. Services provided included; \nm\norning reports, evening reports, noon and midnight reports, sample examination, sample \nrecording via pictures, production of vertical and horizontal mudlog, geo steering, sample \ncollection and bagging, sample mailing and a final end of well report. \n \n2.1.1 Geosteering \n \nOur offset GR TVD logs were from the Wade Federal 5300 41s30 8T2 well, located on the same \nw\nell pad as Wade Federal 5300 41s30 7T. Within the Three Forks 1st Bench, the primary \nob\njective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter layering between \nlimy sandstones and siltstone. Gamma patterns were compared with the offset log and a TVD log \nwas created while landing the curve to in order to land in the targeted zone.  Steering in the \nlateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant gamma markers, as well as by using \nlithology, total gas and ROP to determine our position within the formation. \n \n2.1.2 Gamma and Surveys \n \nGamma and survey MWD services were provided by Schlumberger/Pathfinder.  The majority of \nthe well was drilled within the target area of the Three Forks 1st Bench.   \n \n \n2\n.2 Mud Logging (Columbine Logging, Inc.) \n \n2\n.2.1 Sample Examination \n \nSamples were collected every 30 ft in the straight hole and build section, and every 30 ft while \ndrilling the lateral. Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous content, \nstructure, texture, allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. Carbonate \nidentification was determined with 10% dilute HCls, alizarin red and calcimeter. Hydrocarbon \nf\nluorescence was determined using a fluoroscope with a UV lamp.   \n \n2.2.2 Gas Detection \n \nGas was logged using a Bloodhound total gas/chromatograph system. The gas detection system \nu\nses an infrasred detector to measure total gas and the chromatograph separates and measures \ngases C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4. Gas was recorded in units where 1 unit equals 100 ppm. The gas \ndetection system measured gases: C1, C2, C3, iC4, nC4, H2S, O2 and CO2.  \n \nTh\ne Bloodhound Gas Detection and Chromatograph system use digital signal processing \ntechniques and nonsdispersive infrared and chemical sensors for gas detection.  The system uses \na proprietary chromatograph, which has the capability to detect from 0 to 10,000 gas units.  This \ntranslates as 0 to 100% typical naturallysoccurring hydrocarbon gas mixtures.  Calibration is \nperformed using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibration"

      "text": "gases.  Lab calibration points include 0%, 2.5%, and 100% pure methane.  Complete immunity \nto saturation or damage in the presence of high concentrations of both light and heavy \nhydrocarbon gases precludes the necessity of constant rescalibration or zero referencing. This \nallows the Bloodhound to react to hydrocarbon based gases from zero to 100% in concentration \nwithout dilution. \n \nLag time was approximated from a calculation of annular velocity based on: pump output, opens\nhole diameter, cased hole diameter, collar diameter, drill pipe diameter and bottom hole \nassembly. Connection gases were monitored to confirm lag time calculations and adjustments \nwere made when necessary."

The approval is granted on the \ncondition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries \nand 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre  spacing unit consisting of SECTIONS 29 & 30 T153N R100W.  \nTool error is not required pursuant to order. \n \nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be \nmaintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, a nd must remain on-site during cl ean-out, completion, and flow-\nback whenever filtration operations are conducted.  Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding t he \nentire location.  OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC mu st take into consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety \nRegulation) when contemplating simultaneo us operations on the above captioned location.  Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 \n(Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable electric lighting generato r, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any \nproducing well or oil tank.”  OASIS PE TRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 \nprior to location construction. \n \nDrilling pit \nNDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and comp letion \noperations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and recl aimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and \nfreshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an autho rized \nrepresentative of the director prior to lining and use.   Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director \nprior to placement in a cuttings pit.” \n \nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines  \n  Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.  The proposed dir ectional \nplan is at a legal location.  Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 377’S and \n10042’E. \n \nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period) \n   Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilli ng permit \non the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report.   If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day followin g \npublication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.  Application for a waiver must be b y sworn \naffidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and \nany other information that would allow the Director to conclude  that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drillin g permit, \nthe applicant should retain the permit. \n \nPermit Fee & Notification \n   Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .T he permit fee has been received.  It is requested that notifica tion be given \nimmediately upon the spudding of the well.  This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone.

Such containers must be: \n leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container \n covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container \n placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container \n \nIf the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but \nonly upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request. \n \nAs previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01 \nstates in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production \nwastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by th e North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste \nManagement.  Please contact the Division of Waste Manage ment at (701) 328-5166 w ith any questions on the \nsolid waste program.  Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include pr oduced water, drilling mud, \ninvert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.  \n \nThank you for your cooperation.  \n \n  Sincerely, \n \n  \nBruce E. Hicks \n  Assistant Director"
